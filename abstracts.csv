Despite increased knowledge of the cellular and connective tissue changes involved, neither a cure nor an optimum form of treatment exists. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the best available evidence on the management of this condition.A comprehensive database search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed until August 2017. We studied RCTs comparing open fasciectomy with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA), collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) with placebo, and CCH with PNA, in addition to adjuvant treatments aiming to improve the outcome of open fasciectomy. A total of 20 studies, involving 1584 patients, were included.</AbstractText>: A comprehensive database search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed until August 2017.

Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Therapy for Dupuytren's Disease: A Randomised Dose Response Proof of Concept Phase 2a Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a common fibrotic condition of the hand that causes irreversible flexion contractures of the fingers, with no approved therapy for early stage disease. Our previous analysis of surgically-excised tissue defined tumour necrosis factor (TNF) as a potential therapeutic target. Here we assessed the efficacy of injecting nodules of Dupuytren's disease with a TNF inhibitor.METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive adalimumab on one occasion in dose cohorts of 15 mg in 0.3 ml, 35 mg in 0.7 ml, or 40 mg in 0.4 ml, or an equivalent volume of placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Two weeks later the injected tissue was surgically excised and analysed. The primary outcome measure was levels of mRNA expression for α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2). Secondary outcomes included levels of α-SMA and collagen proteins. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT03180957) and the EudraCT (2015-001780-40).FINDINGS: We recruited 28 patients, 8 assigned to the 15 mg, 12 to the 35 mg and 8 to the 40 mg adalimumab cohorts. There was no change in mRNA levels for ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11. Levels of α-SMA protein expression in patients treated with 40 mg adalimumab (1.09 ± 0.09 ng per μg of total protein) were significantly lower (p = 0.006) compared to placebo treated patients (1.51 ± 0.09 ng/μg). The levels of procollagen type I protein expression were also significantly lower (p &lt; 0.019) in the sub group treated with 40 mg adalimumab (474 ± 84 pg/μg total protein) compared with placebo (817 ± 78 pg/μg). There were two serious adverse events, both considered unrelated to the study drug.INTERPRETATION: In this dose-ranging study, injection of 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 ml resulted in down regulation of the myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by reduction in expression of α-SMA and type I procollagen proteins at 2 weeks. These data form the basis of an ongoing phase 2b clinical trial assessing the efficacy of intranodular injection of 40 mg adalimumab in 0.4 ml compared to an equivalent volume of placebo in patients with early stage Dupuytren's disease.FUNDING: Health Innovation Challenge Fund (Wellcome Trust and Department of Health) and 180 Therapeutics LP.",EBioMedicine,29983350,2018
The risk of skin tear in Dupuytren's disease when treated with collagenase.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to explore if there was a correlation between joint level and degree of contracture on the one hand and the risk of skin tear in Dupuytren's disease (DD) on the other, when treated with collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum. No trial or study has explored the risk of skin tear as primary outcome in a population that has not been treated for DD before.METHODS: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data was performed on patients with DD treated with collagenase from 1 August 2012 to 1 April 2014. Skin tear was classified as &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; and not quantified by tear size for further analysis.RESULTS: A total of 105 contractures in 90 patients with DD were included. In all, 77 contractures at the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint and 28 at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) joint. A total of 59 contractures experienced skin tear. The relative risk (RR) of skin tear was 1.5 for an MP joint of ≥ 60° contracture compared with an MP joint at 20-59° (p = 0.17). The RR of skin tear was 2.2 for a PIP joint of ≥ 60° contracture compared to a PIP joint of 20-59° (p = 0.04). The RR for skin tear was 1.1 for an MP joint compared with the PIP joint (p = 0.74). The RR for skin tear was 1.7 for contractures of ≥ 60° compared to 20-59° regardless of level (p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: There is a significantly higher relative risk of skin tear when the contracture is ≥ 60° and when the contracture is ≥ 60° and located at the PIP joint. The most important factor regarding the risk of skin tear is the degree of the contracture.FUNDING: none.TRIAL REGISTRATION: approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency.",Danish medical journal,29726315,2018

Skin Laceration in Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum Treatment for Dupuytren's Contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture produces a progressive flexion contracture of the affected fingers. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum produces breakdown of the cord in the hand and/or finger(s) that tightens as a result of the disease creating a contracture, allowing manual traction and cord rupture. One of the side effects is spontaneous skin laceration when the finger is extended.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the development of skin lacerations in Dupuytren's contracture treated with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum, to determine predisposing factors, and evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different treatments (antiseptic and non-antiseptic dressings).PARTICIPANTS: Included 157 patients diagnosed with Dupuytren's contracture and treated with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum.METHODS: Analysis of variables and logistic regression model were applied to determine their possible relationship with skin lacerations. The effectiveness of the type of treatment used was evaluated by comparing the amount of time required for healing.RESULTS: Skin lacerations were present in 33.1% (n = 52) of patients, with an average laceration length of 1.12 (SD: 0.70) cm. Characteristics that were significant predisposing factors for lacerations were disease bilateralism (p = .002), previous surgical intervention (p = .003), and initial matacarpophalangeal joint contracture (p &lt; .001). Worse initial contracture (Z = 5.94; p &lt; .001) had a greater risk of laceration as did those who had prior hand surgery, or whose little finger was affected. Average treatment length of healing was 11.24 days (SD: 8.13). All wounds healed successfully. There were no significant differences (p = .511) in healing between different dressings evaluated.CONCLUSIONS: Skin lacerations as a consequence of treating Dupuytren's contracture with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum occur often and are moderately serious. For all cases, evolution is satisfactory in less than 2 weeks, and the type of treatment does not appear to make any difference in healing time.",Orthopedic nursing,29570549,2018

Technique of Dynamic Flexor Digitorum Superficialis Transfer to Lateral Bands for Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Deformity Correction in Severe Dupuytren Disease.,Pseudo-boutonniere deformity is an uncommon complication from long-standing proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture in Dupuytren disease. Prolonged flexion contracture of the PIP joint can lead to central slip attenuation and resultant imbalances in the extensor mechanism. We present a technique of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon transfer to the lateral bands to correct pseudo-boutonniere deformity at the time of palmar fasciectomy for the treatment of Dupuytren disease. The FDS tendon is transferred from volar to dorsal through the lumbrical canal and sutured into the dorsally mobilized lateral bands. This technique presents an approach to the repair of pseudo-boutonniere deformity in Dupuytren disease.,The Journal of hand surgery,29421069,2018

Efficacy and adverse effects of collagenase use in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease: a meta-analysis.,"AIMS: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of collagenase clostridium histolyticum compared with fasciectomy and percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) for Dupuytren's disease.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane, Teseo and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for clinical trials and cohort or case-control studies which compared the clinical outcomes and adverse effects of collagenase with those of fasciectomy or PNF. Of 1345 articles retrieved, ten were selected. They described the outcomes of 425 patients treated with collagenase and 418 treated by fasciectomy or PNF. Complications were assessed using inverse-variance weighted odds ratios (ORs). Clinical efficacy was assessed by differences between the means for movement of the joint before and after treatment. Dose adjustment was applied in all cases.RESULTS: Random-effects modelling showed that patients treated with collagenase had 3.24 increased odds of adverse effects compared with those treated by fasciectomy (OR 4.39) or PNF (OR 1.72,). The effect was lost when only major complications were assessed. Joint movement analysis revealed a difference between means of less than 10%, indicating equivalent clinical efficacy in the short and medium term for collagenase and fasciectomy. We were unable to analyse this for PNF due to a shortage of data.",The bone &amp; joint journal,29305454,2018
Arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the 4th and 5th finger using an interlocking screw device to treat severe recurrence of Dupuytren's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the radiological and functional outcome of arthrodesis of the 4th and 5th finger using the APEX™ (Extremity Medical, Parsippany,NJ)intermedullary interlocking screw system in patients with severe recurrence of Dupuytren's disease.MATERIAL AND METHOD: The DASH questionnaire and the VAS scale were used to assess the clinical outcomes. The angle of arthrodesis, fusion time and implant fixation were evaluated on x-rays. The patients were monitored for complications during surgery and the follow-up period.RESULTS: The sample comprised 6 patients. Mean follow up was 19.6 months. All of the patients presented clinical and radiological evidence of fusion at 8 weeks, with fusion angles of 30° (3) and 45° (3). There were no complications and none of the implants had to be removed. The functional outcomes in these patients were poor.CONCLUSION: The system offers a reliable method for IPJ arthrodesis at a precise angle. It promotes stable fixation that does not require prolonged immobilisation. It can be used together with other procedures on the hand with severe recurrence of DD. The functional outcomes for this group of patients using this device were poor.",Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia,29217349,2017
T2 signal intensity as an imaging biomarker for patients with superficial Fibromatoses of the hands (Dupuytren's disease) and feet (Ledderhose disease) undergoing definitive electron beam irradiation.,"OBJECTIVE: Electron beam therapy is a definitive radiation treatment option for superficial fibromatoses of the hands and feet. Because objective criteria for treatment response remain poorly defined, we sought to describe changes in electron beam treated lesions on MRI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 1 male and 9 female patients with a total of 37 superficial fibromatoses; average age was 60.7 years. Standard 6 MeV electron beam treatment included 3 Gy per fraction for 10 or 12 treatments using split-course with 3-month halfway break. Pre- and post-treatment MRIs were evaluated to determine lesion size (cm3), T2 signal intensity and contrast enhancement (5-point ordinal scales) by a fellowship trained musculoskeletal radiologist. MRI findings were correlated with clinical response using a composite 1-5 ordinal scale, Karnofsky Performance Scale and patient-reported 10-point visual analog scale for pain.CONCLUSIONS: MRI is valuable for evaluating patients undergoing electron beam therapy for superficial fibromatoses: higher pretreatment T2 intensity may predict benefit from radiotherapy. T2 hypointensity may be a better marker than size for therapeutic effect.",Skeletal radiology,29085992,2017
"Effect of Compound 21, a Selective Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Agonist, in a Murine Xenograft Model of Dupuytren Disease.","BACKGROUND: Although surgical excision and intralesional collagenase injection are mainstays in Dupuytren disease treatment, no effective medical therapy exists for recurrent disease.

The authors investigated the potential use of compound 21 in the treatment of Dupuytren disease.METHODS: Human dermal fibroblasts were treated in vitro with compound 21 and assessed for viability using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, migration by means of scratch assay, and profibrotic gene transcription by means of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Compound 21 effects in vivo were assessed using a xenograft model. Dupuytren disease cord specimens from patients undergoing open partial fasciectomy were divided into two segments. Segments were implanted under the dorsal skin of nude mouse pairs. Beginning on day 5, one mouse from each pair received daily intraperitoneal injections of compound 21 (10 μg/kg/day), and the other received vehicle. On day 10, segments were explanted and submitted for immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Human dermal fibroblasts treated with compound 21 displayed decreased migration and decreased gene expression of connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast specific protein-1, transforming growth factor-β1, Smad3, and Smad4. Dupuytren disease segments from compound 21-treated mice demonstrated significantly reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin and Ki67 staining, with increased density of CD31 staining vessels.CONCLUSIONS: Compound 21 significantly decreases expression of profibrotic genes and decreases myofibroblast proliferation as indicated by reduced Ki67 and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. These findings support compound 21 as a potential novel treatment modality for Dupuytren disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,29068929,2017
"Short-term effect of shockwave therapy, temperature controlled high energy adjustable multi-mode emission laser or stretching in Dupuytren’s disease: a prospective randomized clinical trial.","Dupuytren’s disease is a debilitating disease of the hand characterized by nodules on the surface of the palm with progressive loss of finger extension. The chosen forms of treatment are infiltrative and surgical. Conservative treatment could be useful but few studies have been carried out and these regarded mainly stretching exercises and thermo-therapy. To date, no study has analyzed the effects of biostimulation with shock-waves (SW) and high energy laser therapy [Temperature controlled High Energy Adjustable multi-mode emission Laser (THEAL)]. We recruited 45 patients, 32 males and 13 females (average age 63.4 years) affected by early or late stage Dupuytren’s disease [33 metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, 12 proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints]. We randomized the patients into three treatment groups: extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), THEAL and stretching exercises. Follow-ups were at the end of treatment (T1), after 1 month (T2), and after 3 months (T3). The three forms of treatment determined a progressive clinical-functional improvement. The pain relief was statistically significant for SW and THEAL at all follow-ups (FUs) (p&lt;/=0.01). The functional recovery was statistically significant in the SW group at all FUs and in the THEAL and Stretching groups at T1 and T2 (p&lt;0.01). Patient satisfaction level was higher for SW at T2 and T3 and for THEAL at T2 (p&lt;/=0.01). The extension deficit recovery as regards the MCP and PIP joints was statistically significant in the SW group at T1 and T2 (p&lt;/= 0.01) and in the stretching group at T1 (p&lt;0.01). The SW and THEAL treatments appear safe, have good efficacy and are associated with good patient satisfaction in the short and medium terms. Further studies may verify the possibility of repeated cycles and/or combined therapies to improve results.",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,28958137,2017
Variation in Treatment Recommendations for Dupuytren Disease.,"PURPOSE: To examine agreement on Dupuytren disease (DD) treatment recommendations in an international sample of hand surgeons.METHODS: A survey was developed to determine expertise in needle aponeurotomy, surgery, and collagenase injection to treat DD and to examine treatment recommendations for 16 case scenarios. Case scenarios were predeveloped using expert input. Each case represented a unique combination of 4 dichotomous variables including cord thickness, contracture severity, patient age, and joint involvement. Interrater reliability statistics were calculated and multinomial logistic regression modeling and analysis of variance were used to examine the impact of surgeon- and case-related variables on treatment recommendations.RESULTS: A total of 36 hand surgeons from 9 countries (mean experience, 17 years) participated. Average pairwise percent agreement and Krippendorff's alpha were 26% and .012, respectively. Predictors of a recommendation for surgery over multiple options were a total contracture of greater than 70°, a thick precentral cord, involvement of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and greater years in practice. A greater number of years in practice predicted recommendation for collagenase injection and the presence of a thick precentral cord predicted a recommendation for needle aponeurotomy.CONCLUSIONS: Little agreement exists on treatment recommendations for common presentations of DD in this sample.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Further investigation into the sources of potential widespread discrepancies in the management of DD may improve the capacity to make evidence-based recommendations.",The Journal of hand surgery,28951096,2017
A Genome-wide Association Study of Dupuytren Disease Reveals 17 Additional Variants Implicated in Fibrosis.,"Individuals with Dupuytren disease (DD) are commonly seen by physicians and surgeons across multiple specialties. It is an increasingly common and disabling fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia, which leads to flexion contractures of the digits, and is associated with other tissue-specific fibroses. DD affects between 5% and 25% of people of European descent and is the most common inherited disease of connective tissue. We undertook the largest GWAS to date in individuals with a surgically validated diagnosis of DD from the UK, with replication in British, Dutch, and German individuals. We validated association at all nine previously described signals and discovered 17 additional variants with p ≤ 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated correlation of the high-risk genotype at the statistically most strongly associated variant with decreased secretion of the soluble WNT-antagonist SFRP4, in surgical specimen-derived DD myofibroblasts. These results highlight important pathways involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, including WNT signaling, extracellular matrix modulation, and inflammation. In addition, many associated loci contain genes that were hitherto unrecognized as playing a role in fibrosis, opening up new avenues of research that may lead to novel treatments for DD and fibrosis more generally. DD represents an ideal human model disease for fibrosis research.",American journal of human genetics,28886342,2017
Night Orthosis After Surgical Correction of Dupuytren Contractures: A Systematic Review.,"PURPOSE: To determine the role of night orthosis use after surgical correction of Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, OTSeeker, and CENTRAL for articles published from inception of the databases to August 2015. Assessment was undertaken by 2 independent reviewers (O.A.S. and S.A.). Methodological quality of randomized controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa instrument.RESULTS: Seven studies met the standard for inclusion in this review. A total of 659 patients across these 7 studies were included in the analysis, with follow-up ranging from 3 to 72 months. None of the included studies assessed recurrence. The analysis revealed no significant improvement in range of motion of hand joints for patients who received a static night orthosis after Dupuytren surgery compared with patients without an orthosis. Similarly, no differences were found in patient-reported functional status across the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: The current literature does not appear to support the use of static night orthosis in addition to hand therapy after surgical correction of Dupuytren contracture.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,28867249,2017
Efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum for Dupuytren disease nodules: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: To determine the safety and efficacy of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection for the treatment of palmar Dupuytren disease nodules.METHODS: In this 8-week, double-blind trial, palpable palmar nodules on one hand of adults with Dupuytren disease were selected for treatment. Patients were randomly assigned using an interactive web response system to receive a dose of 0.25 mg, 0.40 mg, or 0.60 mg (1:1:1 ratio) and then allocated to active treatment (CCH) or placebo (4:1 ratio). All patients and investigators were blinded to treatment. One injection was made in the selected nodule on Day 1. Caliper measurements of nodule length and width were performed at screening and at Weeks 4 and 8. Investigator-reported nodular consistency and hardness were evaluated at baseline and Weeks 1, 4, and 8. Investigator-rated patient improvement (1 [very much improved] to 7 [very much worse]) and patient satisfaction were assessed at study end.RESULTS: In the efficacy population (n = 74), percentage changes in area were significantly greater with CCH 0.40 mg (-80.1%, P = 0.0002) and CCH 0.60 mg (-78.2%, P = 0.0003), but not CCH 0.25 mg (-58.3%, P = 0.079), versus placebo (-42.2%) at post-treatment Week 8. Mean change in nodular consistency and hardness were significantly improved with CCH versus placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 (P ≤ 0.0139 for all). At Week 8, investigator global assessment of improvement was significantly greater with CCH 0.40 mg and 0.60 mg (P ≤ 0.0014) but not statistically significant with CCH 0.25 mg versus placebo (P = 0.13). Most patients were &quot;very satisfied&quot; or &quot;quite satisfied&quot; with CCH 0.40 mg and 0.60 mg. Contusion/bruising (50.0% to 59.1%) was the most common adverse event with CCH treatment.CONCLUSION: In patients with Dupuytren disease, a single CCH injection significantly improved palmar nodule size and hardness. The safety of CCH was similar to that observed previously in patients with Dupuytren contracture.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02193828 .

A feasibility study investigating the acceptability and design of a multicentre randomised controlled trial of needle fasciotomy versus limited fasciectomy for the treatment of Dupuytren's contractures of the fingers (HAND-1): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Dupuytren's contractures are fibrous cords under the skin of the palm of the hand. The contractures are painless but cause one or more fingers to curl into the palm, resulting in loss of function. Standard treatment within the NHS is surgery to remove (fasciectomy) or divide (fasciotomy) the contractures, and the treatment offered is frequently determined by surgeon preference.

Benefit of Local Anesthesia in Reducing Pain during Collagenase Injection for Dupuytren's Contracture.,"Collagenase injection for Dupuytren's contracture is commonly administered without anesthesia. The authors studied the benefit of injecting local anesthesia before collagenase in reducing treatment-related pain. This prospective cohort study included 187 patients (mean age, 69 years; 80 percent men) at two orthopedic departments in Sweden. At one center, 161 consecutive patients scheduled for collagenase injection were assigned to two groups by alternating outpatient clinics; 78 received collagenase without local anesthesia using a modified method (injecting 0.80 mg in multiple spots in the cord) and 83 received local anesthesia injected in the proximal palm before collagenase. At the other center, 26 consecutive patients received collagenase using the standard method (0.58 mg injected in one spot) without local anesthesia. Immediately after the first injection (collagenase or local anesthesia), the patients rated the severity of injection-related pain on a visual analogue scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Before finger manipulation 1 or 2 days after injection, the patients rated the pain experienced since injection. Mean score ± SD for pain experienced during modified collagenase injection was 4.3 ± 2.5 without local anesthesia and 2.3 ± 1.7 during injection of local anesthesia (before collagenase) (age- and sex-adjusted mean difference, 2.1; 95 percent CI, 1.5 to 2.7; p &lt; 0.001). Mean pain score ± SD during standard collagenase injection without local anesthesia was 4.8 ± 1.8. Mean pain score ± SD during the injection-manipulation interval was 2.9 ± 1.9 in the group without local anesthesia and 2.9 ± 2.3 in the local anesthesia group (p = 0.79). This study shows that local anesthesia significantly reduces the patient's overall pain experience during collagenase treatment for Dupuytren's contracture.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,28841617,2017
Low second to fourth digit ratio in Dupuytren disease.,"The ratio of the lengths of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) has been described as reflecting endogenous prenatal androgen exposure. In general, 2D:4D is lower in men than in women and has potential as a biomarker or predictor for various diseases, athletic ability, and academic performance. Dupuytren disease has digital flexion contractures and is known to predominate in men, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. To clarify the relationships between Dupuytren disease and endogenous androgens, we performed a retrospective analysis of hand radiographs to investigate 2D:4D in Dupuytren disease. The study included male patients with Dupuytren disease (n = 22) and a control group (n = 18) of male patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Only unaffected hands, without contractures or osteoarthritis, were evaluated for the purpose of radiographic assessment. The lengths of the phalanx and metacarpal bones in the second and fourth digits were measured by 2 independent observers who each performed 2 sets of measurements separated by a minimum 1-week interval. The 2D:4D was calculated separately for the phalanges and metacarpals, and a combined (phalanx + metacarpal) 2D:4D was also calculated. The reliability of the observer measurements was established using the intraclass correlation coefficient, and both the intra- and interobserver reliability showed excellent agreement. We found that compared with control group, the Dupuytren disease group had significantly lower phalanx and combined 2D:4D. These findings suggest that endogenous prenatal androgens could contribute to the development of Dupuytren disease, leading to its characteristic clinical presentation predominantly in men and affecting the ulnar rays.",Medicine,28816972,2017
Dupuytren's contracture and handwork: A case-control study.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the association between Dupuytren's contracture (DC), repetitive handwork (RHW), heavy handwork (HHW), and/or vibration exposure.METHODS: Frequency and intensity of the three types of handwork were collected and compared between DC patients and controls. Hours of work were weighted by average &quot;frequency,&quot; for RHW, and average &quot;intensity,&quot; for HHW and use of vibrating tool. Logistic regression was used to evaluate risk of developing DC associated with the above-mentioned factors.RESULTS: Data from 129 cases (74 clinical, 106 controls) was analyzed. Family history, male gender and age (decades) were associated with increased risk of DC. Results indicate that the risk becomes substantial after about 30 years of steady RHW. Independent effects of intensity-weighted HHW and vibrating exposure were not established.CONCLUSIONS: Frequency-weighted RHW increases DC risk. Additionally, a strong association between DC, male gender and heredity was found.",American journal of industrial medicine,28692190,2017
Dupuytren's disease: my personal view.,"Dupuytren's disease is a heterogenous condition for which a palette of treatment options is required. Randomized control trial evidence is sparse; design challenges, such as validated outcome measures, blinding, equipoise, funding and assessment of recurrence, may limit further data accrual. Recurrence has different significance with different treatments and so rates are not directly comparable. The risk of any treatment is a function of both the chance of a complication and the clinical sequelae of that complication. The patient must be intimately involved in choosing treatment and is often trading rapid recovery for a higher chance of recurrence. Health economies are strained and as custodians of healthcare, surgeons should consider whether many patients even need treatment. To minimize the chance of complex, hazardous and expensive revision surgery, a low threshold for primary skin grafting should be applied, especially for those who are young, have dense disease or vulnerable genes.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28669261,2017
Involvement of the Interosseous and Lumbrical Muscle-Tendon Units in the Lateral and Spiral Cords in Dupuytren's Disease of the Middle Fingers.,"BACKGROUND: The nature of intrinsic muscle involvement in Dupuytren's disease of the middle fingers (long and ring) remains poorly characterized. Over the years, the authors have observed that both the spiral and lateral digital cords in the middle fingers receive contribution from intrinsic muscle-tendon units. This report describes the anatomical characteristics and frequency of intrinsic muscle-tendon unit involvement in Dupuytren's disease of the middle fingers.METHODS: Intrinsic muscle involvement in the middle digits was recorded in the operative reports of patients undergoing Dupuytren's surgery between October of 2013 and February of 2016. The anatomical variations of diseased fascia were delineated and classified.RESULTS: Of the 113 digits with Dupuytren's contracture operated on during this period, 52 involved the middle fingers (12 long and 40 ring fingers). Intrinsic muscles were found to be involved in the contracture of 14 of these digits. Two unique contracture patterns were identified: type I contracture, which involves a lateral digital cord originating from intrinsic muscle-tendon units and contracting only the proximal interphalangeal joint; and type II contracture, which involves a spiral cord receiving contribution from intrinsic muscle-tendon units and contracting both the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. The frequency of type I and type II contractures was 6 percent and 12 percent, respectively.CONCLUSION: Intrinsic hand muscles may contribute to Dupuytren's disease in the middle digits, and the authors suggest resecting cords as close as possible to their musculotendinous origin to improve postoperative outcomes.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,28654597,2017
Outcome of Dupuytren Contractures After Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injection: A Single-institution Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection is an alternative to surgery for patients with Dupuytren disease (DD) of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. The success of surgical and nonsurgical treatment modalities for DD is reported to vary widely between 25% and 80% (J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1985;67:1439-1443; Plast Reconstr Surg. 2007;120:44e-54e; J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2007;89:189-198; J Hand Surg Am. 2011:36:936-942; J Hand Surg Am. 1990;15:755-761; J Hand Surg Br. 1996;21:797-800; J Bone Joint Surg Br. 2000;82:90-94; Plast Reconstr Surg. 2005;115:802-810; Ann Plast Surg. 2006;57:13-17). This study presents the outcomes of patients with DD contractures treated with CCH injections at a single institution.METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was conducted of patients with DD of the hand treated with CCH injections in a single institution from February 2010 to April 2015. All patients received the recommended dose of 0.58 mg of CCH and returned for joint manipulation the following day. Data for follow-up at 7 and 30 days postoperatively and up to 5 years for patients who returned seeking further therapy for recurrent symptoms were reviewed.RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients with a total of 146 affected joints (72 MCP; 74 PIP) were treated with CCH injections (95 males; 18 females; age, 40-92 y). Successful CCH therapy occurred in 75% of injected joints (109/146 joints; 59 MCP; 50 PIP), as defined by less than 5 degrees of contracture after treatment. Twenty-three percent of treated joints had partial correction (34/146 joints; 13 MCP; 21 PIP), as defined by between 5 and 30 degrees of residual contracture after treatment. Three patients (2%) had a failure of treatment, as defined by unchanged or worsened contracture from pretreatment baseline measurements. Fifteen patients (13%) returned to the clinic seeking additional therapy for recurrent joint contracture symptoms in 17 joints over a span of 1.5 months to 4 years after initial successful or partially successful treatment (17/143, 12%; 5 MCP; 12 PIP). Recurrence was defined as patients who sought treatment for a return of symptoms or greater than 20 degrees contracture in the setting of a palpable cord after initial full or partial contracture correction.DISCUSSIONS: Our 5-year outcome of CCH injections for DD contractures revealed full correction in 75% and partial correction in 23% of treated joints, with failure of treatment seen in only 2% of patients. Thirteen percent of the patients returned for additional treatment because of symptoms resulting from contracture recurrence in 12% of initially corrected or partially corrected joints. These positive outcomes are comparable with current surgical treatment modalities (J Hand Surg Am. 1990;15:755-761; J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1962;44B:602-613; J Clin Epidemiol. 2000;53:291-296). The use of CCH injections is an important nonsurgical treatment alternative for DD contractures of the MCP and PIP joints.",Annals of plastic surgery,28604542,2017
Ultrasonographic examination of the ruptured cord after collagenase treatment or needle fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Local treatment of Dupuytren's contracture, either by collagenase or needle fasciotomy, allows disruption of the pathological cord during forced extension. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cord before and after both treatments by ultrasound. A total of 39 patients with a minimum of 20° contracture in the metacarpophalangeal joint were included and randomized to treatment with either collagenase (20 patients) or needle fasciotomy (19 patients). The distance between the distal and the proximal parts of the ruptured cord was measured by ultrasound and the difference in passive joint movement before and after treatment was measured with a goniomenter. There were no significant differences between the collagenase and needle fasciotomy groups in the size of the rupture or gain of mobility. Most cords treated with collagenase and subsequent forced extension had the same ultrasonographic appearance as cords disrupted mechanically by needle fasciotomy.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28587568,2017
Early Postoperative Results of Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy in 451 Patients with Dupuytren Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is a minimally invasive treatment modality for Dupuytren disease. In this study, the authors analyzed the efficacy and complication rate of percutaneous needle fasciotomy using a statistical method that takes the multilevel structure of data, regarding multiple measurements from the same patient, into account.METHODS: The data of 470 treated rays from 451 patients with Dupuytren disease that underwent percutaneous needle fasciotomy were analyzed retrospectively. The authors described the early postoperative results of percutaneous needle fasciotomy and applied linear mixed models to compare mean correction of passive extension deficit between joints and efficacy of primary versus secondary percutaneous needle fasciotomy.RESULTS: Mean preoperative passive extension deficits at the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joints were 37, 40, and 31 degrees, respectively. Mean preoperative total passive extension deficit was 54 degrees. Results were excellent, with a mean total passive extension deficit correction of 85 percent. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy was most effective for metacarpophalangeal joints and less effective for proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. Secondary percutaneous needle fasciotomy was as effective as primary percutaneous needle fasciotomy. Complications were rare and mostly minor.CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that percutaneous needle fasciotomy is an effective and safe treatment modality for patients with mild to moderate disease who prefer a minimally invasive procedure.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,28538569,2017

Recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture: A consensus-based definition.,"PURPOSE: One of the major determinants of Dupyutren disease (DD) treatment efficacy is recurrence of the contracture. Unfortunately, lack of agreement in the literature on what constitutes recurrence makes it nearly impossible to compare the multiple treatments alternatives available today. The aim of this study is to bring an unbiased pool of experts to agree upon what would be considered a recurrence of DD after treatment; and from that consensus establish a much-needed definition for DD recurrence.METHODS: To reach an expert consensus on the definition of recurrence we used the Delphi method and invited 43 Dupuytren's research and treatment experts from 10 countries to participate by answering a series of questionnaire rounds. After each round the answers were analyzed and the experts received a feedback report with another questionnaire round to further hone in of the definition. We defined consensus when at least 70% of the experts agreed on a topic.RESULTS: Twenty-one experts agreed to participate in this study. After four consensus rounds, we agreed that DD recurrence should be defined as &quot;more than 20 degrees of contracture recurrence in any treated joint at one year post-treatment compared to six weeks post-treatment&quot;. In addition, &quot;recurrence should be reported individually for every treated joint&quot; and afterwards measurements should be repeated and reported yearly.CONCLUSION: This study provides the most comprehensive to date definition of what should be considered recurrence of DD. These standardized criteria should allow us to better evaluate the many treatment alternatives.",PloS one,28505187,2017
Radiotherapy in Dupuytren's disease: a systematic review of the evidence.,"Radiotherapy has been advocated as an alternative treatment in early Dupuytren's disease. We have systematically reviewed the evidence on the use of radiotherapy in Dupuytren's disease. Only six articles met a minimum set standard, five of which were retrospective cohort studies and one a randomized controlled study. A total of 770 Dupuytren's hands, nearly all with Tubiana stage 0-1 disease, were irradiated with an average 30 Gy. Disease regression ranged from 0%-56%, stability from 14%-98% and progression from 2%-86%. Salvage surgery was successful in all cases of disease progression post-radiotherapy. There were no reports of adverse wound healing problems associated with such surgery or radiotherapy-associated malignancy. On balance, radiotherapy should be considered an unproven treatment for early Dupuytren's disease due to a scarce evidence base and unknown long-term adverse effects. Well-designed randomized controlled studies are required to confirm the benefits of radiotherapy treatment.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28490266,2017
Angiotensin receptors in Dupuytren's disease: a target for pharmacological treatment?,"BACKGROUND: Attempts at the pharmacological treatment of Dupuytren's disease have so far been unsuccessful, and the disease is not yet fully understood on a cellular level. The Renin-Angiotensin System has long been understood to play a circulating hormonal role. However, there is much evidence showing Angiotensin II to play a local role in wound healing and fibrosis, with ACE inhibitors being widely used as an anti-fibrotic agent in renal and cardiac disease.METHODS: This study was designed to investigate the presence of Angiotensin II receptors 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) in Dupuytren's tissue to form a basis for further study into the pharmacological treatment of this condition. Tissue was harvested from 11 patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's disease. Each specimen was processed into frozen sections and immunostaining was employed to identify AT1 and AT2 receptors.RESULTS: Immunostaining for AT1 receptors was mildly positive in one patient and negative in all the remaining patients. However, all specimens stained extensively for AT2 receptors. This suggests that the expression of AT2 receptors is more prominent than AT1 receptors in Dupuytren's disease.CONCLUSION: These findings have opened a new avenue for future research involving ACE inhibitors, AT2 agonists, and AT2 antagonists in Dupuytren's disease.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,28486091,2017
Injectable Collagenase Versus Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy for Dupuytren Contracture in Proximal Interphalangeal Joints: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"PURPOSE: Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection was introduced commercially as a treatment for Dupuytren contracture following initial phase-3 investigations in 2009 with promising results. However, the efficacy of CCH has not been prospectively investigated in a direct comparison to other active treatments of Dupuytren contracture with more than 1-year follow-up, despite a wide and increasing clinical use.METHOD: In this prospective, independent, open-label, randomized controlled trial, (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT 01538017), percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) was directly compared with CCH. Fifty patients with primary isolated proximal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren contractures were enrolled and followed for 2 years. The primary outcome was clinical improvement defined as a reduction in contracture by 50% or more relative to baseline. Secondary outcomes included change in contracture, recurrence, adverse events, complications, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire score.RESULTS: Clinical improvement at 2 years was maintained in 7% of CCH patients (2 of 29) and 29% of PNF patients (6 of 21). Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum led to more, mainly transient, complications, in 93% of patients versus 24% of the patients treated with PNF. No other differences were observed.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that CCH is not superior to PNF in the treatment of isolated proximal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren contracture regarding clinical outcome, and it led to more complications than PNF.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.",The Journal of hand surgery,28473158,2017
[The Extended Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy Technique (PNF+) For Dupuytren's Contracture].,"The extended percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF+) is a minimal invasive technique especially suitable for treating severe Dupuytren's contractures and recurrences. The familiar needle fasciotomy is complemented by a spontaneous tearing of the skin and a full-thickness graft to cover the defect. Skin tears in fingers and palm are not a complication, but an integral part of the PNF+. The neurovascular bundles remain intact. This surgical procedure may be repeated as often as required.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",28423443,2017

The Use of Residual Collagenase for Single Digits With Multiple-Joint Dupuytren Contractures.,"PURPOSE: Standard 0.58 mg (0.25 mL) collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) preparations result in unused CCH that is often discarded. Our purpose was to assess the results on Dupuytren contractures affecting both the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints in the same digit utilizing an injection containing the maximum CCH volume that can be withdrawn from a single vial.METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with MCP and PIP cords in the same digit received a single treatment with 2 injections totaling 0.30 mL distributed between the MCP and the PIP cords and underwent manipulation approximately 24 hours later. Reduction in contracture, clinical success, and complications were assessed 30 days after manipulation.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (34 digits) had a mean preinjection flexion contracture of 50° at the MCP joint and 53° at the PIP joint. Clinical success (reduction in joint contracture to 0°-5° of full extension 30-days postmanipulation) was noted in 65% of MCP cords and 38% of PIP joint cords. We had a 24% incidence of skin tears, which correlated with the degree of preinjection contracture.CONCLUSIONS: For Dupuytren contractures involving the MCP and PIP joints in the same digit, distributing the maximum amount of CCH that can be withdrawn from a single vial provides efficacy at both joints that is similar to that reported in previously published series, with a comparable complication rate. Utilizing excess CCH typically discarded may provide cost savings.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,28389081,2017

Treatment of Recurrent Dupuytren Contracture in Joints Previously Effectively Treated With Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum.,"PURPOSE: Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is approved for the treatment of adults with Dupuytren contracture with a palpable cord. This open-label, phase 4 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of CCH for the retreatment of recurrent contractures in joints that were previously effectively treated with CCH.METHODS: Patients participating in a long-term follow-up study who had contracture recurrence (increased ≥ 20° with a palpable cord) after successful treatment in the previous study were eligible. Recurrent joint contractures were treated with up to 3 CCH injections (∼ 1 month apart). Patients were followed for 1 year to evaluate safety. Assessments included change in joint contracture, range of motion, and the percentage of joints that achieved contracture of 5° or less at day 30 after the last injection.RESULTS: The efficacy analysis included 51 patients with 1 treated joint per patient (31 metacarpophalangeal, 20 proximal interphalangeal). A total of 35 joints (69%) received 1 injection, 12 (24%) received 2 injections, and 4 (8%) received 3 injections. Fifty-seven percent of joints achieved contracture of 5° or less (29 of 51). Overall, 86% (43 of 50) patients had a 20° or greater increase in range of motion. The adverse event profile was consistent with previous studies. One ligament injury was reported.CONCLUSIONS: At a short-term follow-up of 1 year, recurrent contracture in joints previously successfully treated with CCH may be effectively retreated with up to 3 injections of CCH.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,28341067,2017
Acute Gout Following Dermofasciectomy in a Patient With Dupuytren Disease.,"A 62-year-old man underwent uncomplicated dermofasciectomy of the right little finger.

Long-term follow-up of Dupuytren disease after injection of triamcinolone acetonide in Chinese patients in Taiwan.,"Injection of triamcinolone acetonide is a non-operative treatment for early-stage Dupuytren disease in Caucasians, but its effectiveness in non-Caucasians is unclear. We report averaged 5-year follow-up results of 37 patients (49 affected hands) with early-stage Dupuytren disease for patients in Taiwan (non-Caucasian) who received a single dose of 5 mg triamcinolone acetonide injection into nodules monthly for 3 months. Using ultrasound, we recorded no progression of sizes of the modules following injection after 6 months. After an average 5-year follow-up, two patients with three hands (6%) experienced reactivation of the treated nodules. None required surgical intervention. Ultrasound examination showed that sizes of the treated Dupuytren nodules decreased significantly by 40% 6 months after injection and 56% at the final follow-up. We conclude that in these Chinese patients in Taiwan with early Dupuytren nodules, triamcinolone acetonide injection was effective in reducing the size of the Dupuytren nodules and maintaining long-term durable control of the nodular growth.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",28183220,2017
Adverse Effects of Collagenase in the Treatment of Dupuytren Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) has proven to be both safe and effective in the treatment of Dupuytren disease (DD). The medium-term outcomes are similar to those achieved with surgery, and most adverse effects are self-limiting and considered to be mild or moderate.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the adverse effects of CCH in DD since the release of the drug to evaluate the incidence, severity, classification, and definitions of these effects.METHODS: We analyzed the literature in terms of modifications to the original treatment protocol and grouped adverse effects according to their pathophysiological origin.RESULTS: We included 28 clinical studies and five case reports or case series analyzing 4456 patients with a mean age of 63.6 years. Mean follow-up was 7.07 months (range 3-24); the mean number of patients per study was 148 (range 5-1082). The studies did not classify the adverse effects they reported into groups. The most common effects were peripheral edema (54.4%), bruising (42.9%), and upper limb pain (28.3%). Significant biases were observed for use of terminology, demarcation of sites of involvement, severity criteria, and assessment methods.CONCLUSION: A simpler and clearer consensus-based classification system would enable better evaluation and comparison of the adverse effects of CCH in the treatment of DD. Consideration of inflammatory phenomena as part of the drug's mechanism of action would significantly reduce overall rates of adverse effects.","BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",28181175,2017

Pain Associated With Treatment of Dupuytren Contracture With Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum.,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to quantify the degree of pain associated with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection and to determine whether it is related to other factors in the intervention.METHODS: A prospective study of 135 patients was performed to evaluate pain at 3 points during treatment: (1) after CCH injection, using a numerical rating scale (NRS), (2) a binary (positive/negative) assessment before manipulation 24 hours after CCH and after removing the bandage, and (3) after joint manipulation performed with wrist block anesthesia.RESULTS: The average NRS for pain during infiltration was 4.7. Pain was present before manipulation in 52.6% of patients. Pain from manipulation showed an average NRS score of 3.6. The amounts of pain at CCH infiltration, pain after 24 hours, and pain from the manipulation were correlated because patients who experienced pain during CCH infiltration were more likely to report experiencing pain during manipulation.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection for treating Dupuytren contracture can be a painful process. There is a clear relationship between a patient's level of pain during injection of CCH and the likelihood that the patient will experience pain during manipulation, even with the use of local anesthesia.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,28160905,2017
[Treatment of recurrent Dupuytren's disease].,"BACKGROUND: The tendency of recurrence or progression is a frequent problem in Dupuytren's disease. The management of recurrence is adapted to the individual situation and the patient's needs. In mild cases a non-operative approach is recommended. Revision surgery is reserved for disabling situations with acceptable circulation and sensation in absence of dystrophy. It is complicated by a combined formation of scar tissue and new cords. This increases the risk of soft tissue loss and injuries to the neurovascular bundles, which impair sensation and circulation and may result in loss of the finger.TECHNIQUE: The strategy consists of preoperative planning of the soft tissue reconstruction, meticulous preparation of the neurovascular bundles, arthrolyses and skin closure by Z‑plasty or transposition flaps. The corrective arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint may be an alternative to improve function without the risks of revision surgery. In cases of severe impaired circulation, sensation or dystrophy of the finger, amputation or ray resection may be indicated.",Der Orthopade,28160036,2017

Proximodistal interphalangeal arthrodesis of the little finger: A series of 7 cases.,"As an alternative to amputation of the little finger, we report here seven cases of shortening arthrodesis carried out by resecting the middle phalanx and proximodistal interphalangeal (PDIP) arthrodesis. Our cohort consisted of 6 males and 1 female (58years average age), with a stiff little finger secondary to Dupuytren's disease or trauma. All fingers were approached dorsally; after resection of the middle phalanx and decortication of the subchondral bone, fusion of the remaining phalanges was performed using an intramedullary self-breaking screw-pin. At a mean follow-up of 34.9months, pain decreased significantly (1.4/10 versus 5.4/100 preoperatively), the QuickDASH score improved significantly (33/100 versus 51/100 preoperatively) and all the joints had fused. One patient suffered from cold intolerance.

To remember: Radiotherapy - a successful treatment for early Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibroproliferative condition of the hand which tends to cause progressive digital flexion contracture. Therapeutic strategies to treat the disease include radiotherapy, injections of collagenase clostridium histolyticum, needle fasciotomy and extended surgical intervention dependent on involvement and duration of the disease. We have reviewed the literature with the aim to assess the conditions and effects of radiotherapy in DD. In early stages of the disease, radiotherapy resulted in regression of symptoms/a lack of progression found on average in 40% (range 10-85%)/81% (range 50-100%) of the patients with recurrence rates of only 12-31% after long-term follow-up (&gt;4 years). These results proved to be significantly better than in the untreated patients with natural course of the disease (about 50% progression after a follow-up of 5-6 years). Long-term side-effects (skin dryness) are observed on average in one quarter of the patients, but are well tolerated. Local occurrence of malignancies has not been reported yet. Due to severe functional impairment leading to individual suffering and the high economic burden, treatment of DD in early stages is necessary and radiation therapy represents an effective, safe and economic treatment option.",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,27428598,2016
Effectiveness and safety of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum in Dupuytren's disease : an observational study in Belgium.,"Dupuytren's disease is a connective tissue disorder leading to contractures. It can be treated surgically or through injections of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH). Patients with Dupuytren's contracture (&gt; 20°) and a palpable cord were included in this observational study, aiming to characterise the Belgian patient population and to assess the effectiveness and safety of CCH. Overall, 108 patients (114 joints) received at least one injection of CCH, and 104 patients completed the study. The percentages of joints achieving a degree of contracture of 5° or less, or a relative contracture reduction of at least 50% after the extension procedure were 64.9% and 90.1%, respectively. The mean number of injections per cord was 1.0. The Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main score decreased from 29.4 ± 11.0 to 12.9 ± 6.3 (mean ± SD ; p &lt; 0.0001).

Dupuytren disease is highly prevalent in male field hockey players aged over 60 years.,"AIM: Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative hand condition. The role of exposure to vibration as a risk factor has been studied with contradictory results. Since field hockey is expected to be a strong source of hand-arm vibration, we hypothesised that long-term exposure to field hockey is associated with Dupuytren disease.METHODS: In this cross-sectional cohort study, the hands of 169 male field hockey players (IQR: 65-71 years) and 156 male controls (IQR: 59-71 years) were examined for signs of Dupuytren disease. Details about their age, lifestyle factors, medical history, employment history and leisure activities were gathered. Prior to the analyses, the groups were balanced in risk factors using propensity score matching. The association between field hockey and Dupuytren disease was determined using a subject-specific generalised linear mixed model with a binomial distribution and logit link function (matched pairs analysis).RESULTS: Dupuytren disease was observed in 51.7% of the field hockey players, and in 13.8% of the controls. After propensity score matching, field hockey playing as dichotomous variable, was associated with Dupuytren disease (OR=9.42, 95% CI 3.01 to 29.53). A linear dose-response effect of field hockey (hours/week x years) within the field hockey players could not be demonstrated (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.56).DISCUSSION: We found that field hockey playing has a strong association with the presence of Dupuytren disease. Clinicians in sports medicine should be alert to this less common diagnosis in this sport.",British journal of sports medicine,27660370,2016

Comorbidity in Dupuytren disease.,"In this report, a possible association between Dupuytren's disease (DD) and other health problems was investigated. The health problems included in this study are : cardiac ischemia, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, malignancy, asthma and COPD. The data of 725 patients with DD were collected from -Intego, a database including all morbidity presented to the General Practitioners (GPs) in Flanders. The control group of 2900 age and sex matched non-DD patients was selected from the same database. A possible influence of severity of DD was evaluated by comparing the data of 333 patients operated for DD with the group of Integopatients with DD. This study showed a significant association of every single studied health condition with DD. Comparison of the -operated group with the group from Intego with DD, demonstrated only some significant associations, a difference which may be explained by the difference in data collection.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,29119908,2016
Predictors of Patient Satisfaction with Hand Function after Fasciectomy for Dupuytren's Contracture.,"BACKGROUND: This study examined patient satisfaction with hand function after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture and determined which preoperative patient- and disease-specific factors predicted this satisfaction.METHODS: Demographics and disease-specific factors were assessed from a prospective cohort of 194 patients who completed the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire preoperatively and underwent limited fasciectomy between 2011 and 2014 at six hand surgery practice sites. To evaluate satisfaction with hand function, patients were asked to complete the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire during the first year after fasciectomy. After patients were classified into a satisfied and an unsatisfied category using the question that specifically pertains to satisfaction with hand function, the authors applied multivariate logistic regression modeling to identify independent predictors of patient satisfaction.RESULTS: At an average of 10 months (range, 6 to 12 months) after fasciectomy, 84 percent (n = 163) of the patients were satisfied with their hand function. In multivariate analyses adjusting for the degree of postoperative residual contracture (p &lt; 0.001) and complications (p &lt; 0.001), a higher preoperative Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire hand appearance subscore and male gender predicted a higher likelihood of becoming satisfied after fasciectomy. Other patient- and disease-specific factors did not show evidence for an association with patient satisfaction.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that providers should consider assessing concerns about the appearance of the hand in patients with Dupuytren's contracture. They also highlight the importance of complication prevention and full contracture correction from the patient's perspective.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, III.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,27556605,2016
[Comparative Cost Effectiveness of Clostridium Histolyticum Collagenase (Xiapex®) and Partial Fasciectomy for the Treatment of Dupuytren's Contracture in Austria].,"INTRODUCTION: Since Dupuytren's contracture is a common disorder, the costs for its surgical treatment impose a considerable burden on the healthcare system. For the first time in the German-speaking area, this study aimed to provide a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis for partial fasciectomy vs. treatment with Clostridium histolyticum collagenase (CCH).METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study of the period from 2012 to 2014 comprised 40 patients with previously untreated Dupuytren's contracture of one finger. 20 outpatients received one CCH treatment (Group 1), while 20 inpatients underwent partial fasciectomy (Group 2). The direct pre-interventional treatment and post-interventional costs were compared.RESULTS: The direct post-interventional and postoperative results were comparable. Group 1 (CCH) showed a mean reduction in contracture of 96.4%; in Group 2 (partial fasciectomy), this was 97.7%. There were fewer complications in Group 1 than in Group 2. Mean treatment costs in Group 1 were € 1 458.60 and in Group 2, € 5 315.20.CONCLUSION: Treatment with CCH is more cost effective than with partial fasciectomy. This is due to greater costs for personnel, time and surgical material, as well as the treatment of the more frequent complications in Group 2. Despite the limited comparability, our findings are consistent with the present international literature.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",27547932,2016
The Impact of Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum Introduction on Dupuytren Treatment Patterns in the United States.,"PURPOSE: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) in the United States in February 2010. This study addresses the impact of that approval on the number of Dupuytren contracture (DC) encounters and treatment patterns in the United States.METHODS: Using the Intercontinental Marketing Services Health Office-Based Medical Claims database, we identified the monthly number of DC encounters and DC procedures between January 2007 and December 2013. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum usage data from March 2010 to December 2013 was derived from the U.S. CCH manufacturer's data warehouse. Using the combined data, the yearly increasing trends in DC encounters and treatment volume were compared before and after the introduction of CCH. Time trends in the relative procedure frequencies were then examined. Finally, the presence of seasonal variation was tested for in each treatment type.RESULTS: Dupuytren contracture encounters increased on average by 19,015 per year between 2007 and 2009, whereas between 2011 and 2013, DC encounters increased on average by 34,940 per year. In terms of absolute procedure counts, the surgery trend line began decreasing in 2010 with the release of CCH. Meanwhile, CCH continuously increased between 2010 and 2013, and needle aponeurotomy (NA) remained relatively stable. By the year 2013, minimally invasive techniques (NA and CCH) comprised 39% of all treatment, compared with only 14% in 2007. Lastly, there was a statistically significant seasonal increase in the number of surgical procedures during the wintertime but no seasonal variation in NA or CCH.CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of CCH, the number of Dupuytren encounters increased at a greater annual rate. The introduction and growth of CCH coincided with a decrease in surgery. The number of NA procedures remained steady throughout the study period. The number of open surgery cases followed a predictable seasonal variation with more procedures during the winter months, but this seasonal variation was not seen with less invasive techniques.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic/Decision Analysis II.",The Journal of hand surgery,27546441,2016
Systematic review of non-surgical treatments for early dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a common fibrotic disorder of the palm characterized by the development of progressive flexion deformities in the digits, leading to significant functional impairment. Surgical excision remains the most common treatment. However, this is only indicated in patients with established contractures rather than those with early disease. Early disease is generally characterized by the presence of palmar nodules with limited or no contracture of the fingers. The ideal treatment would be directed at patients with early progressive disease to prevent future deterioration. Various non-surgical treatment modalities have been described but there is currently no systematic assessment of the role and efficacy of these treatments in patients with early disease.</AbstractText>: Dupuytren's disease is a common fibrotic disorder of the palm characterized by the development of progressive flexion deformities in the digits, leading to significant functional impairment.

"Comparison of Treatment Outcome After Collagenase and Needle Fasciotomy for Dupuytren Contracture: A Randomized, Single-Blinded, Clinical Trial With a 1-Year Follow-Up.","PURPOSE: This study compared the efficacy of collagenase treatment and needle fasciotomy for contracture of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint in Dupuytren disease.METHODS: This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized study with follow-up 1 week and 1 year after treatment. One hundred and forty patients with an MCP contracture of 20° or more in a single finger were enrolled, of whom 69 patients were randomized to collagenase treatment and 71 patients to needle fasciotomy. The patients were followed at 1 week and were examined by a physiotherapist after 1 year. Measurements of joint movement and grip strength were recorded as well as patient-perceived outcomes measured by the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) for the estimation of procedural pain and subjective treatment efficacy.RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of the patients in the collagenase group and 90% of the patients in the needle fasciotomy group had a reduction in their MCP contracture to less than 5° 1 week after treatment, and the median gains in passive MCP movement were 48° and 46°, respectively. The median VAS score for procedural pain was 4.9 of 10 in the collagenase group and 2.7 of 10 in the needle fasciotomy group. After 1 year, 90% of the patients in both groups had full extension of the treated MCP joint. One patient in each group had a recurrence of the contracture. The median improvement in URAM score was 8 units in both groups and the VAS estimation of treatment efficacy by the patients was 8.7 of 10 in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between the treatment outcomes after collagenase and needle fasciotomy treatment after 1 year.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.",The Journal of hand surgery,27473921,2016
Measurement Properties of the Brief Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire in Patients With Dupuytren Contracture.,"PURPOSE: The brief Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (briefMHQ) was developed as a shorter version of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), but its measurement properties have not been investigated in patients with Dupuytren contracture. The objective of the study was to investigate the reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability of the briefMHQ.METHODS: Fifty-seven patients diagnosed with Dupuytren contracture completed the briefMHQ as well as the full-length MHQ and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire at baseline. Two to 14 days after baseline and 1 year after collagenase injection or surgery, patients again filled out the briefMHQ. Reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient and by calculating internal consistency (Cronbach alpha). Validity was tested by quantifying correlations with the full-length MHQ and QuickDASH. Responsiveness, based on the standardized response mean and the minimally clinically important change, was also determined.RESULTS: The briefMHQ had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87, Cronbach alpha of 0.88, and correlations of r = 0.88 and -0.82 with the original MHQ and QuickDASH, respectively. The standardized response mean was 0.9 and the minimally clinically important change was 7 points.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the briefMHQ demonstrates excellent reliability, good validity, and high responsiveness in patients with Dupuytren contracture.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The briefMHQ is an accurate and time-saving tool to evaluate patients with Dupuytren contracture and the effect of a corresponding treatment.",The Journal of hand surgery,27469936,2016
Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies and Network Analysis-Based Integration with Gene Expression Data Identify New Suggestive Loci and Unravel a Wnt-Centric Network Associated with Dupuytren's Disease.,"Dupuytren´s disease, a fibromatosis of the connective tissue in the palm, is a common complex disease with a strong genetic component. Up to date nine genetic loci have been found to be associated with the disease. Six of these loci contain genes that code for Wnt signalling proteins. In spite of this striking first insight into the genetic factors in Dupuytren´s disease, much of the inherited risk in Dupuytren´s disease still needs to be discovered. The already identified loci jointly explain ~1% of the heritability in this disease. To further elucidate the genetic basis of Dupuytren´s disease, we performed a genome-wide meta-analysis combining three genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, comprising 1,580 cases and 4,480 controls. We corroborated all nine previously identified loci, six of these with genome-wide significance (p-value &lt; 5x10-8). In addition, we identified 14 new suggestive loci (p-value &lt; 10-5). Intriguingly, several of these new loci contain genes associated with Wnt signalling and therefore represent excellent candidates for replication. Next, we compared whole-transcriptome data between patient- and control-derived tissue samples and found the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to be the top deregulated pathway in patient samples. We then conducted network and pathway analyses in order to identify protein networks that are enriched for genes highlighted in the GWAS meta-analysis and expression data sets. We found further evidence that the Wnt signalling pathways in conjunction with other pathways may play a critical role in Dupuytren´s disease. ",PloS one,27467239,2016

Collagenase From Vibrio alginolyticus Cultures: Experimental Study and Clinical Perspectives.,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the activity of collagenase from cultures of Vibrio alginolyticus as in vitro as in biological samples and to evaluate clinical perspectives of this product about the treatment of fibroproliferative diseases like Dupuytren's contracture. Methods The experimental part of the study has been divided in 2 stages. In the first stage, the collagenase has been produced in laboratory, assessing its purity, verifying the in vitro degradation of collagen by the enzyme and measuring the size of the fragments; in the second part, an experimental injection into samples of fibrous cord typical of Dupuytren's disease has been performed in vitro. For the injection we used only collagenase, or collagenase after having subjected them to 2 types of mechanical stress or a collagenase combined with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid. Considering that the human samples have been treated in vitro, our institution does not require a specific informed consent. Results It appeared evident that the collagenase obtained from Vibrio alginolyticus (nonpathogenic bacterium) is highly pure (&gt;98%) and does not contain nonspecific protease. The collagenase from Vibrio alginolyticus therefore has an excellent degradative capacity against the collagen and this activity takes on a dose- and time-dependent behavior. The collagenase from Vibrio alginolyticus does not act negatively on cell survival and collagen peptides obtained may provide a better proliferative stimulus compared to controls. Conclusions The collagenase from Vibrio alginolyticus, given its obvious ability in vitro and biological samples, could be an option in the nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease.

Dupuytren's Disease in an Adolescent - Case Report.,"Dupuytren's disease is typically observed in adults, in children and adolescents being rarely diagnosed. Only several cases were reported in children under the age of 10 years, including two infants under one year. There were no such reports in Polish literature. We presented a case of Dupuytren's disease in a 17 year-old adolescent, in whom the first signs of the disease were observed in early childhood. ",Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,27428838,2016
Comparative Effectiveness of Percutaneous Needle Aponeurotomy and Limited Fasciectomy for Dupuytren's Contracture: A Multicenter Observational Study.,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy is a less invasive surgical alternative to limited fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture, but appeared less efficacious in a previous randomized clinical trial. This study compared the effectiveness of both techniques in contemporary clinical practice.METHODS: The authors evaluated prospectively gathered data from all patients who were treated with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy or limited fasciectomy between 2011 and 2014 at six hand surgery practice sites in The Netherlands. The degree of total active extension deficit, Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire subscores, and complications evaluated at 6 to 12 weeks after treatment were compared after propensity score-based inverse-probability weighting to account for the differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups.RESULTS: After inverse-probability weighting, 78 percutaneous needle aponeurotomy patients and 103 limited fasciectomy patients remained with similar characteristics (88 percent Tubiana grade I or II). The degree of total residual extension deficit at follow-up was similar between the weighted groups (percutaneous needle aponeurotomy, 21 degrees; limited fasciectomy, 18 degrees; p = 0.330). Furthermore, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy was associated with a lower mild complication rate (percutaneous needle aponeurotomy, 5.2 percent; limited fasciectomy, 24.3 percent; p &lt; 0.001) and larger increases in the subdomain scores of satisfaction (p &lt; 0.001), work performance (p &lt; 0.001), activities of daily living (p = 0.009), and overall hand function (p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter observational study found that, among patients with mildly to moderately affected digits, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy reduced contractures as effectively as limited fasciectomy does in clinical practice. Furthermore, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy provided a more rapid functional recovery and had a lower rate of mild complications.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,27307334,2016
Similar Distributions of Dupuytren's Contracture and Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I Among Modern Europeans Suggest Simultaneous Spreading of These Traits Some 40 to 10 KYA.,"A proposition is made that when two independent traits show similar regional patterns of incidence among modern European regions, a plausible expectation is that these two, otherwise unrelated traits, have simultaneously been spread by migration of our ancestors. As a potential example for the proposed concept, distribution of patients with Dupuytren's contracture is here compared with the reported European distribution of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I, a genetic marker linked to the last glaciation period.",Collegium antropologicum,27301240,2016
Dupuytren Disease Infiltrating a Full-Thickness Skin Graft.,"Although the role of the skin in the development and propagation of Dupuytren disease remains unclear, dermofasciectomy and full-thickness skin grafting (FTSG) appears to delay recurrence. In 2011, a 71-year-old, left-handed man presented with recurrent Dupuytren disease in the dominant hand. In 1991, he originally underwent a primary dermofasciectomy and FTSG for Dupuytren disease involving the palmar skin. Twenty years later, the left middle finger was drawn into flexion by a recurrent cord, and the old graft and adjacent palmar skin were clinically involved by fibromatosis. We performed a revision dermofasciectomy and FTSG. Microscopic analysis of the excised graft demonstrated dense infiltration of the entire skin graft by Dupuytren disease, with areas of active and burnt-out fibromatosis distinct from hypertrophic scarring. This report of Dupuytren fibromatosis infiltrating a skin graft raises questions about the pathophysiology of Dupuytren disease. ",The Journal of hand surgery,27282210,2016
"Dupuytren's disease susceptibility gene, EPDR1, is involved in myofibroblast contractility.","BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's Disease is a common disorder of the connective tissue characterized by progressive and irreversible fibroblastic proliferation affecting the palmar fascia. Progressive flexion deformity appears over several months or years and although usually painless, it can result in a serious handicap causing loss of manual dexterity. There is no cure for the disease and the etiology is largely unknown. A genome-wide association study of Dupuytren's Disease identified nine susceptibility loci with the strongest genetic signal located in an intron of EPDR1, the gene encoding the Ependymin Related 1 protein.OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigate the role of EPDR1 in Dupuytren's Disease.METHODS: We research the role of EPDR1 by assessing gene expression in patient tissue and by gene silencing in fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL) assay, which is used as an in vitro model of Dupuytren's contractures.RESULTS: The three alternative transcripts produced by the EPDR1 gene are all detected in affected Dupuytren's tissue and control unaffected palmar fascia tissue. Dupuytren's tissue also contracts more in the FPCL paradigm. Dicer-substrate RNA-mediated knockdown of EPDR1 results in moderate late stage attenuation of contraction rate in FPCL, implying a role in matrix contraction.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest functional involvement of EPDR1 in the etiology of Dupuytren's Disease.",Journal of dermatological science,27245865,2016
"Percutaneous Aponeurotomy and Lipofilling (PALF) versus Limited Fasciectomy in Patients with Primary Dupuytren's Contracture: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial.","BACKGROUND: As an alternative to needle aponeurotomy release and limited fasciectomy treatment of Dupuytren's contracture, the authors introduced an extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy and lipofilling (PALF) procedure. In their previous study, the authors reported that contractures significantly improved and most patients returned to normal use of the hand within 2 to 4 weeks. To establish the safety and efficacy of PALF, the authors compared it to the standard limited fasciectomy in a single-blind, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.METHODS: Patients with a primary Dupuytren's contracture were assigned randomly to the limited fasciectomy group or the PALF group. Patients were measured at baseline and at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Primary outcome of the trial was contracture correction and convalescence time. Groups were compared using a mixed models approach.RESULTS: Eighty patients were randomized to PALF or limited fasciectomy. In both groups, almost full metacarpophalangeal joint contracture correction was obtained, whereas for the proximal interphalangeal joint, some residual contracture remained. Patients in the PALF group returned significantly earlier to their normal daily activity. At 1 year after surgery, no significant differences in recurrence rate or hand function were present. However, limited fasciectomy seems to have a higher incidence of permanent complications.CONCLUSIONS: PALF demonstrates a significantly shorter convalescence, similar operative contracture correction, lower incidence of long-term complications, and no significant difference regarding 1-year postoperative results compared with limited fasciectomy. It is therefore a valuable, minimally invasive alternative to limited fasciectomy in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,27219235,2016
[Treatment Methods for Patients with Dupuytren's Disease in Switzerland].,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate what treatment options are currently used in Switzerland for Dupuytren's disease. Furthermore, regional preferences and treatment differences based on surgeon experience were analysed.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to all members of the Swiss Society for Hand Surgery. Participants were asked to indicate their current treatment methods for Dupuytren's disease. In addition, 8 standard patient cases were presented to identify the preferred treatment option. Furthermore, sociodemographic data of the participants were gathered.RESULTS: In total, 70 questionnaires were completed, corresponding to a response rate of 34%. Fasciectomy is performed by 94% of participants, while 59% inject collagenase in certain cases, 40% perform open fasciotomy, and 24% carry out percutaneous needle aponeurotomy if the indication is given. 20% of responders offer one of these techniques, 50% offer 2, 23% offer 3, and 7% offer all 4 treatment techniques. In the case of isolated metacarpophalangeal joint contracture, 51% of participants inject collagenase, whereas fasciectomy is preferred for the treatment of proximal interphalangeal joint contractures or in cases of recurrence. In German-speaking Switzerland, the treatment strategy has changed towards applying collagenase injections in the past 5 years. In this part of the country, 83% of surgeons now use more collagenase than 5 years ago, whereas only 33% of surgeons in French-speaking Switzerland have changed their treatment strategy in favour of collagenase injections (p=0.027). Surgeons with less than 10 years of experience apply more collagenase than their more experienced colleagues (79 vs. 54%, p=0.131).CONCLUSIONS: In Switzerland, fasciectomy is the preferred option for treating patients with Dupuytren's disease. In recent years, however, collagenase injection has become more and more popular. More research is needed to define guidelines for the treatment of patients with Dupuytren's disease considering the effectiveness of the different treatment options and regional preferences.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",27203235,2016
[Evaluation of influence of Dupuytryen contracture's operative treatment on increase of quality of hand's function basing on research in use PEM (Patient Evaluation Measure) questionnaire].,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's contracture is a progressive fibrosis of facial structures of the palmar surface of the hand, gradually leading to a reduction of its functions by impaired range of motion of fingers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical material consisted of 95 patients treated surgically in the Second Department of Surgery of the Jagiellonian University in 2006 - 2011 because of Dupuytren's contracture. Based on a study using PEM questionnaire (Patient Evaluation Measure) an assessment of the quality of life before and after surgery was made.RESULTS: The average numeric value obtained in the PEM questionnaire before surgery was 30 points (SD ± 14.35). The postoperative controls were found of gradual decrease in the value and so after three months it was 22.39 points (SD ± 14.23), and after a year it reached the value of 18.12 points (SD ± 12.43). Statistically significant correlations (p &lt; 0.001) were demonstrated between test results of PEM taken before and after 3 and 12 months after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that Dupuytren's contracture has negative impact on quality of life but the quality of life improves after surgical treatment.",Przeglad lekarski,27197428,2016

Patient Satisfaction With Collagenase.,"PURPOSE: To establish patient satisfaction after collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 213 patients who had been treated for Dupuytren disease with CCH were reviewed between 37 and 1421 days after injection.RESULTS: A total of 73% of the patients were very satisfied or satisfied, and 21% were dissatisfied; 75% would probably or definitely have CCH again, whereas 17% probably or definitely would not. We found that satisfaction and willingness to undergo a second treatment decreased over time and had a negative relationship with recurrence. Dissatisfaction was greater in those with a poor initial outcome but not in those with an initial complication. Of 212 patients, 78 had previously experienced surgery for Dupuytren disease of whom 71% would prefer CCH to surgery and 15% the converse. Satisfaction shows a relationship with function as measured by both QuickDASH and the Southampton Dupuytren Scoring Scheme.CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction with CCH is generally high but deteriorates over time as the disease recurs. To manage patient expectation, this issue should be made explicit to patients in the consent process.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Overall satisfaction with CCH is high, with initial satisfaction rates especially good. Forewarning of complications and recurrence can help maintain satisfaction levels.",The Journal of hand surgery,27132016,2016

The efficacy of open partial aponeurectomy for recurrent Dupuytren's contracture.,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the efficacy of open partial aponeurectomy for recurrent Dupuytren's contracture.METHODS: Eighteen patients with recurrent Dupuytren's contracture of 22 fingers were retrospectively assessed with a mean follow-up time of 94 months (range: 70-114 months). Examination parameters included the determination of range of motion (ROM), grip strength, pain and subjective outcome (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire).SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Dissection with special regard to former skin incision and expected wound defect. Modified incisions after Bruner (Mini-Bruner incisions) were facilitated. Dissection started at the palm. Fibrous tissue was resected proximally within the palm including vertical fibrotic septae. Direct preparation of the neurovascular bundles (NVB) was facilitated from proximal to distal. If the anatomy of the neurovascular structures became unclear around the natatory ligament preparation of the NVB at the distal end of the fibrous cord was performed. After complete preparation of a NVB, dissection was continued from medial to lateral until the other bundle was completely released. Transposition flaps and skin transplants were often used for sufficient wound closure.RESULTS: Recurrence rate was 36 % applying the definition of van Rijssen et al. Fifteen patients had a grip strength of 90 % or higher in comparison to the contralateral side. Ten patients had a pinch strength of 90 % or higher in comparison to the contralateral side. All patients except for one had pain reduction or none postoperatively. Fifteen patients had a DASH score of 15 or lower (range: 0-47). An unrelated ray amputation was suffered due to wound healing complications.CONCLUSIONS: Open partial aponeurectomy performed by a board certified hand surgeon proved to be safe. The postoperative functional outcome seemed to be related to the individual course of the disease.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,27038313,2016

Characterisation of the inflammatory response in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is characterised by fibrotic nodule and cord formation in the palmar aponeurosis. The pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, although cell stress and subsequent activation of immune mechanisms seems to be crucial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgically obtained tissue and blood samples of 100 Dupuytren patients were processed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, as well as immunoscope analysis. Macroscopically normal aponeurotic tissue served as control.RESULTS: Locally, microvascular alterations and massive infiltration by mononuclear cells (CD3+, CD4 &gt; CD8, CD45RO &gt; CD45RA, S100 protein, CD56, CD68, scarce CD19 and mast cells) forming perivascular clusters were found in DD tissue. Cytokine profiling of fibromatosis tissue-derived T-cells showed a Th1/TH17-weighted immune response. Immunoscope analysis revealed a restricted T-cell receptor α/β repertoire pointing to an (auto)antigen-driven process.CONCLUSION: The striking accumulation of immune cells, expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, as well as pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines near markedly narrowed vessels supports the theory that the abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts and production of extracellular matrix proteins in DD seems to be related to immune-mediated microvascular damage. The restricted T-cell receptor repertoire of intra-lesional T-cells points to an antigen-driven process. T-cells seem to play an important role in the development of Dupuytren's disease.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,26852784,2016
Collagenase Treatment for Dupuytren Disease of the Thumb and First Web.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum to treat thumb and first web contractures in Dupuytren disease.METHODS: We prospectively included 14 thumbs in 12 patients with a contracture at the metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joint of at least 20° with a palpable cord in the thumb (n = 8) or an adduction contracture of the thumb with palpable cords in the first web (n = 6). They received an injection containing 0.58 mg of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum in the fibrous cord divided over 3 spots. The contracture was released by carefully manipulating the thumb under local anesthesia 1 day later. The extension and abduction deficits were measured before and after the intervention (follow-up at 7 and 30 days and 6 months). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze the data.RESULTS: In the total sample, postintervention extension deficits were statistically significantly lower than preintervention deficits except in one patient who had a recurrence at 6 months compared with the 30-day posttreatment result. Intermetacarpophalangeal head distance (IMD) also improved significantly. In an analysis of subgroups, we compared the separate contributions of treatment of a pretendinous cord and a first web cord on both extension deficit and IMD. Treatment of pretendinous cords significantly affected both extension deficit and IMD. However, treatment of first web contractures did not significantly improve extension or IMD.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum is a good treatment option for pretendinous cords in thumbs affected with Dupuytren disease because it provides good results, is minimally invasive, and has minor adverse events.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,26803569,2016
Clusters in Short-term Disease Course in Participants With Primary Dupuytren Disease.,"PURPOSE: The course of Dupuytren disease (DD) is thought to be progressive; however, the course differs for each patient. The purpose of this study was to study the rate and pattern of progression of DD.METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the course of DD at intervals of 3 to 6 months in 247 Dutch participants with primary DD by measuring the surface area of nodules and cords and the total passive extension deficit. The association between surface area and Tubiana stage was tested with generalized estimating equations. Latent class models were used to study different clusters in changes regarding the course of the disease.RESULTS: The variance in disease course between participants was large. Regarding the change in surface area (in all fingers) and total passive extension deficit (in the ring and little finger), different clusters were observed. Progression of disease was seen but there were also signs of stability and even regression. Patients with a smaller surface area at baseline were more likely to exhibit regression.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that DD is not always progressive and that up to 75% of patients have a different short-term disease course, such as stability or even regression of disease. This should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of treatment for early-phase DD and in the design of future studies. Furthermore, this information may be useful when counseling patients.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic II.",The Journal of hand surgery,26787409,2016
Does collagenase injection disrupt or digest the Dupuytren's cord: a magnetic resonance imaging study.,"Collagenase clostridium histolyticum has been extensively studied as a treatment modality for Dupuytren's contracture. Its mechanism of action has been documented. It is unknown whether injected collagenase weakens the Dupuytren's cord sufficiently to cause failure during manipulation or if there is digestion and reduction in cord volume. We examined five patients with isolated contractures of the ring or middle metacarpalphalangeal (MP) joint using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to injection with collagenase and again 1 month following injection. All patients had full correction after manipulation which was maintained at follow-up. The Dupuytren's cord was evaluated with respect to volume, signal intensity, inflammatory changes and continuity. Additionally, signal intensity changes of the flexor tendons and neurovascular structures were recorded. MRI demonstrated cord discontinuity, significant reduction of cord volume and a significant increase in cord signal intensity after treatment with collagenase. There was a slight increase in flexor tendon signal intensity that was not significant. These findings suggest that there may be local chemical dissolution of the cord. Future studies may establish whether or not this will have prognostic implications in terms of correction and recurrence following collagenase injection.</AbstractText>: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum has been extensively studied as a treatment modality for Dupuytren's contracture.

What are we measuring? A critique of range of motion methods currently in use for Dupuytren's disease and recommendations for practice.,"BACKGROUND: Range of motion is the most frequently reported measure used in practice to evaluate outcomes. A goniometer is the most reliable tool to assess range of motion yet, the lack of consistency in reporting prevents comparison between studies. The aim of this study is to identify how range of motion is currently assessed and reported in Dupuytren's disease literature. Following analysis recommendations for practice will be made to enable consistency in future studies for comparability. This paper highlights the variation in range of motion reporting in Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: A Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study design format was used for the search strategy and search terms. Surgery, needle fasciotomy or collagenase injection for primary or recurrent Dupuytren's disease in adults were included if outcomes were monitored using range of motion to record change. A literature search was performed in May 2013 using subject heading and free-text terms to also capture electronic publications ahead of print. In total 638 publications were identified and following screening 90 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data was extracted and entered onto a spreadsheet for analysis. A thematic analysis was carried out to establish any duplication, resulting in the final range of motion measures identified.RESULTS: Range of motion measurement lacked clarity, with goniometry reportedly used in only 43 of the 90 studies, 16 stated the use of a range of motion protocol. A total of 24 different descriptors were identified describing range of motion in the 90 studies. While some studies reported active range of motion, others reported passive or were unclear. Eight of the 24 categories were identified through thematic analysis as possibly describing the same measure, 'lack of joint extension' and accounted for the most frequently used.CONCLUSIONS: Published studies lacked clarity in reporting range of motion, preventing data comparison and meta-analysis. Percentage change lacks context and without access to raw data, does not allow direct comparison of baseline characteristics.

[Flap plasty in advanced Dupuytren's disease].,"OBJECTIVE: Tension-free skin closure after partial aponeurectomy of fingers in Dupuytren's disease with flexion contracture.INDICATIONS: Contractures of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint &gt;30° in Dupuytren's disease cannot sufficiently treated by Z-plasty due to the contracted skin conditions.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Preoperative scar tissue or impaired circulation in the operation region and infections.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: The primary plan is to place a sliding flap into the incision line with the PIP joint in a flexed position, under regional anesthesia and temporary arrest of the blood supply of the upper arm by cuffing. Definitive incising round the sliding flap after achieving a PIP extension position and covering of the sliding flap either by another dorsal side flap or by full thickness skin graft.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Immobilization in a palmar splint, hand physiotherapy and massaging of the scar.RESULTS: In the time period June 2008 to December 2010 a total of 40 patients were surgically treated. The preoperative angle of contracture in the PIP joint was 30-60° in 25 patients (group 1), 60-90° in 10 patients (group 2) and &gt; 90° in 5 patients (group 3). The angle of contracture 12 months postoperatively was 10-15° in group 1, 20-30° in group 2 and 30-40° in group 3 and after 24 months 15-20° in group 1, 30-45° in group 2 and 40-60° in group 3 . The angle of contracture of the PIP joint was greatest for digit 5. Revision surgery resulted in a poorer outcome. Recovery of sensation lasted up to 2 years after surgery. Complications which occurred were problems in wound healing (4), loss of a flap (1), partial loss of the skin transplant without revision (3), arthrodesis (1) and amputation of digit 5 (1).",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,26729483,2016
Supplementary arthrolysis of the proximal interphalangeal finger joint in Dupuytren's contracture: primary operation versus revision.,"INTRODUCTION: In operative treatment of Dupuytren's disease, in certain cases proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) flexion contracture remains after fasciectomy which can be corrected by a supplementary arthrolysis, but few data comparing primary and revision surgery are available.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients who had a fasciectomy and supplementary PIP arthrolysis at the affected finger for the first time were compared to 13 patients who had a revision fasciectomy with a supplementary PIP arthrolysis. Upon follow-up at 22 months, flexion contracture was measured and data were compared to the preoperative values. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the operation was determined and patients completed the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand outcome measure questionnaire.RESULTS: Fingers of patients with Dupuytren's disease that had a partial fasciectomy and supplementary arthrolysis of the PIP for the first time had a median residual PIP flexion contracture of 30° compared 39° of fingers that had a partial fasciectomy and supplementary arthrolysis of the PIP as a revision. The patients of both groups were equally satisfied with the outcome of the operation, while their DASH scores were nearly identical.CONCLUSION: After a mean follow-up of 2 years, the outcome of recurrent PIP contracture is comparable in patients with Dupuytren's disease that were treated by partial fasciectomy and supplementary arthrolysis for the first time and as a revision.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,26714475,2015
Patients' Preferences for Treatment for Dupuytren's Disease: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Although in modern medicine, patients' preferences are important, these have never been defined for characteristics of Dupuytren treatment. This study determines these patients' preferences using a discrete choice experiment.METHODS: A multicenter discrete choice experiment study was conducted among patients with Dupuytren's disease who had been treated previously. Patients were asked about their preferences for attributes of Dupuytren treatments using scenarios based on treatment method, major and minor complication rates, recurrence rates, convalescence, residual extension deficit after treatment, and aesthetic results. The relative importance of these attributes and the tradeoffs patients were willing to make between them were analyzed using a panel latent class logit model.RESULTS: Five-hundred six patients completed the questionnaire. All above-mentioned attributes proved to influence patients' preferences for Dupuytren treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Men who stated they performed heavy labor made different tradeoffs than women or men who did not perform heavy labor. In general, recurrence rate (36 percent) and extension deficit (28 percent) were the most important attributes in making treatment choices, followed by minor complication rate (13 percent). Patients accepted an increase in recurrent disease of 11 percent if they could receive needle aponeurotomy treatment instead of limited fasciectomy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of low recurrence rates and complete contracture corrections, but also emphasizes the significance of low complication rates. Convalescence was not an attribute, which scored high. The preference heterogeneity shows that patient consultations need to be targeted differently, which may result in different treatment decisions, depending on patient characteristics and preferences.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,26710020,2015
Dupuytren's disease therapy: targeting the vicious cycle of myofibroblasts?,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a proliferative fibromatosis of the hand, which causes permanent flexion contracture of the digits and, ultimately, loss of function. The treatment of DD is complex and involves surgical and nonsurgical approaches, with the goal of removing the affected tissue. New biological targets are under investigation in order to develop innovative therapies.AREAS COVERED: The etiology of DD is still unknown. Several authors who focused their studies on the genetics of DD recognized an inherited autosomal dominant pattern. Actually, DD is a multifactorial and complex disease. Myofibroblasts are thought to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis, although their origin is not clear.EXPERT OPINION: There is a general consensus that a better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of DD will lead to the design of more specific and effective treatment alternatives. In this review, the authors hypothesize a new biological model for DD pathology, where myofibroblasts enhance the reservoir of the disease acting as if in a vicious cycle. This could help, ultimately, in identifying new therapeutic strategies to treat this common and disabling fibroproliferative disorder.",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,26690790,2015
Injectable collagenase Clostridium histolyticum as a nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease using collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH).INDICATIONS: Metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (20-100°) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (20-80°) contractures.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy, previous hypersensitivity to collagenase or excipients, anticoagulant use within 7 days prior to treatment.INJECTION TECHNIQUE: CCH injected directly into the Dupuytren's cord weakening the contracted cord. After injection, the patient returns the following day to allow CCH to lyse the collagen within the cord. An extension force is then applied to the involved finger to disrupt the weakened cord.POSTMANIPULATION MANAGEMENT: Use of extension splint at night, movement instructions during the day.RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (107 men; 13 women; mean age 62 years, range 30-84 years) were treated. In 49% the little finger, in 44% the ring finger, in 4% the middle finger, and in 3% the index finger was treated. Full release was achieved in 71%, partial release in 26%, and no change in 3% of patients. The median pretreatment contracture for the MP joint was 37° (range 25-100°) and PIP joint 51° (range 30-97°). At 12 months, the mean contracture for the MP joint was 9° (range 0-25°) and for the PIP joint 21° (range 10-36°). Adverse events observed in 96% of patients for 3 months .

Surgery for Dupuytren's contracture of the fingers.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibroproliferative disorder that causes the fingers to be drawn into the palm via formation of new tissue under the glabrous skin of the hand. This disorder causes functional limitations, but it can be treated through a variety of surgical techniques. As a chronic condition, it tends to recur.OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of different surgical procedures for treatment of Dupuytren's contracture of the index, middle, ring and little fingers.SEARCH METHODS: We initially searched the following databases on 17 September 2012, then re-searched them on 10 March 2014 and on 20 May 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library, the British Nursing Index and Archive (BNI), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE-In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, ProQuest (ABI/INFORM Global and Dissertations &amp; Theses), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov. We reviewed the reference lists of short-listed articles to identify additional suitable studies.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials and controlled clinical trials in which groups received surgical intervention for Dupuytren's disease of the index, middle, ring or little finger versus control, or versus another intervention (surgical or otherwise). We excluded the thumb, as cords form on the radial aspect of the thumb and thus are not readily accessible in terms of angular deformity. Furthermore, thumb disease is rare.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A minimum of two review authors independently reviewed search results to select studies for inclusion by using pre-specified criteria, assessed risk of bias of included studies and extracted data from included studies.We grouped outcomes into the following categories: (1) hand function, (2) other patient-reported outcomes (e.g. satisfaction, pain), (3) early objective outcomes (e.g. correction of angular deformity), (4) late objective outcomes (e.g. recurrence) and (5) adverse effects.MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 articles describing 13 studies, comprising 11 single-centre studies and two multi-centre studies. These studies involved 944 hands of 940 participants; of these, 93 participants were reported twice in separate articles describing early and late outcomes of one trial. Three papers reported the outcomes of two trials comparing different procedures. One trial compared needle fasciotomy versus fasciectomy (125 hands, 121 participants), and the other compared interposition firebreak skin grafting versus z-plasty closure of fasciectomy (79 participants). The other 11 studies reported trials of technical refinements of procedures or rehabilitation adjuncts. Of these, three investigated effects of postoperative splinting on surgical outcomes.Ten studies (11 articles) were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of varying methodological quality; one was a controlled clinical trial. Trial design was unclear in two studies awaiting classification. All trials had high or unclear risk of at least one type of bias. High risks of performance and detection bias were particularly common. We downgraded the quality of evidence (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation - GRADE) of outcomes to low because of concerns about risk of bias and imprecision.Outcomes measured varied between studies. Five articles assessed recurrence; two defined this as reappearance of palpable disease and two as deterioration in angular deformity; one did not explicitly define recurrence.Hand function on the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Scale (scores between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment) was 5 points lower after needle fasciotomy than after fasciectomy at five weeks. Patient satisfaction was better after fasciotomy at six weeks, but the magnitude of effect was not specified. Fasciectomy improved contractures more effectively in severe disease: Mean percentage reduction in total passive extension deficit at six weeks for Tubiana grades I and II was 11% lower after needle fasciotomy than after fasciectomy, whereas for grades III and IV disease, it was 29% and 32% lower.Paraesthesia (defined as subjective tingling sensation without objective evidence of altered sensation) was more common than needle fasciotomy at one week after fasciectomy (228/1000 vs 67/1000), but reporting of complications was variable.By five years, satisfaction (on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores showing greater satisfaction) was 2.1/10 points higher in the fasciectomy group than in the fasciotomy group, and recurrence was greater after fasciotomy (849/1000 vs 209/1000). Firebreak skin grafting did not improve outcomes more than fasciectomy alone, although this procedure took longer to perform.One trial investigated four weeks of day and night splinting followed by two months of night splinting after surgery. The other two trials investigated three months of night splinting after surgery, but participants in 'no splint' groups with early deterioration at one week were issued a splint for use. All three studies demonstrated no benefit from splinting. The two trials investigating postoperative night splinting were suitable for meta-analysis, which demonstrated no benefit from splinting: Mean DASH score in the splint groups was 1.15 points lower (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.32 to 4.62) than in the no splint groups. Mean total active extension in the splint groups was 2.21 degrees greater (95% CI -3.59 to 8.01 degrees) than in the no splint groups. Mean total active flexion in the splint groups was 8.42 degrees less (95% CI 1.78 to 15.07 degrees) than in the no splint groups.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, insufficient evidence is available to show the relative superiority of different surgical procedures (needle fasciotomy vs fasciectomy, or interposition firebreak skin grafting vs z-plasty closure of fasciectomy). Low-quality evidence suggests that postoperative splinting may not improve outcomes and may impair outcomes by reducing active flexion. Further trials on this topic are urgently required.",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,26648251,2015
[Supplementary arthrolysis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of fingers in surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture].,"OBJECTIVE: Correction of residual flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint after excision of diseased connective tissue in Dupuytren's contracture by stepwise arthrolysis.INDICATIONS: Flexion deformity of the PIP joint of 20° or more after excision of the diseased connective tissue in Dupuytren's contracture.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Joint deformities, osteoarthrosis, intrinsic muscle contracture, instability of the PIP joint.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Arthrolysis of the PIP joint is performed by six consecutive steps: dissection of the remaining skin ligaments, opening the flexor tendon sheath by transverse incision at the distal end of the A2 pulley, dissection of the checkrein ligaments, dissection of the accessory collateral ligaments, releasing the palmar plate proximally, releasing the palmar plate up to its insertion at the middle phalanx base.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Dorsal plaster of Paris with extended fingers and compressive dressing in the palm for 2 days, occupational/physical therapy, static and possible dynamic extension splint several weeks/months.RESULTS: A total of 31 fingers in 28 patients with Dupuytren's contracture were evaluated an average of 22 months after arthrolysis of the PIP joint. In all, 26 joints with an average recurrent flexion contracture of 29° were improved compared to the preoperative flexion contracture of 81°; 4 PIP joints with a recurrent flexion contracture averaging 60° were worse.

One-year results of needle fasciotomy and collagenase injection in treatment of Dupuytren's contracture: A two-centre prospective randomized clinical trial.,"The objective of this study was to compare early and 1 year outcome of needle fasciotomy and collagenase injection for Dupuytren's disease. Inclusion criteria were primary Dupuytren's contracture excluding the thumb with a palpable cord and a total extension deficit, i.e. a fixed flexion from 30° to 135° with less than 60° in the proximal interphalangeal joint. The most affected ray was randomized to either treatment at two centres. Passive extension deficits for each joint before and after treatment, and at 3 and 12 months, were recorded together with complications. A total of 96 rays in 93 patients were included. The average total extension deficits before treatment were 60° or more in both groups, and were largely made up of contractures at the metacarpophalangeal joints. The deficits were reduced by 75% in both groups at 3 months and by 70% in both groups at 12 months. Four patients in the needle fasciotomy group and eight patients in the collagenase group had skin ruptures. At 3 months and 1 year, the outcomes of needle fasciotomy and collagenase injection are the same in Dupuytren's disease with predominantly metacarpophalangeal joint involvement.</AbstractText>: The objective of this study was to compare early and 1 year outcome of needle fasciotomy and collagenase injection for Dupuytren's disease.

Collagenase enzymatic fasciotomy for Dupuytren contracture in patients on chronic immunosuppression.,"Collagenase enzymatic fasciotomy is an accepted nonsurgical treatment for disabling hand contractures caused by Dupuytren disease. We conducted a study to investigate use of collagenase in an immunosuppressed population. We retrospectively reviewed data from 2 academic hand surgical practices. Eight patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapies were treated with collagenase for digital contractures between 2010 and 2011. Thirteen collagenase enzymatic fasciotomies were performed in these 8 patients. Mean preinjection contracture was 53.0°. At mean follow-up of 6.7 months, mean magnitude of contracture improved to 12.9°. Mean metacarpophalangeal joint contracture improved from 42.0° to 4.2°. Mean proximal interphalangeal joint contracture improved from 65.8° to 21.7°. Three of the enzymatic fasciotomies were complicated by skin tears. There were no infections. As more patients seek nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren disease, its safety and efficacy in select cohorts of patients should continue to be evaluated prospectively.

Collagenase clostridium histolyticum for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture: systematic review and economic evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a slowly progressive condition of the hand, characterised by the formation of nodules in the palm that gradually develop into fibrotic cords. Contracture of the cords produces deformities of the fingers. Surgery is recommended for moderate and severe contractures, but complications and/or recurrences are frequent. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) has been developed as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery for some patients.OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of collagenase as an alternative to surgery for adults with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord.DATA SOURCES: We searched all major electronic databases from 1990 to February 2014.REVIEW METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised comparative studies and observational studies involving collagenase and/or surgical interventions were considered. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. A de novo Markov model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of collagenase, percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) and limited fasciectomy (LF). Results were reported as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate model and parameter uncertainty.RESULTS: Five RCTs comparing collagenase with placebo (493 participants), three RCTs comparing surgical techniques (334 participants), two non-randomised studies comparing collagenase and surgery (105 participants), five non-randomised comparative studies assessing various surgical procedures (3571 participants) and 15 collagenase case series (3154 participants) were included. Meta-analyses of RCTs assessing CCH versus placebo were performed. Joints randomised to collagenase were more likely to achieve clinical success. Collagenase-treated participants experienced significant reduction in contracture and an increased range of motion compared with placebo-treated participants. Participants treated with collagenase also experienced significantly more adverse events, most of which were mild or moderate. Four serious adverse events were observed in the collagenase group: two tendon ruptures, one pulley rupture and one complex regional pain syndrome. Two tendon ruptures were also reported in two collagenase case series. Non-randomised studies comparing collagenase with surgery produced variable results and were at high risk of bias. Serious adverse events across surgery studies were low. Recurrence rates ranged from 0% (at 90 days) to 100% (at 8 years) for collagenase and from 0% (at 2.7 years for fasciectomy) to 85% (at 5 years for PNF) for surgery. The results of the de novo economic analysis show that PNF was the cheapest treatment option, whereas LF generated the greatest QALY gains. Collagenase was more costly and generated fewer QALYs compared with LF. LF was £1199 more costly and generated an additional 0.11 QALYs in comparison with PNF. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £10,871 per QALY gained. Two subgroup analyses were conducted for a population of patients with moderate and severe disease and up to two joints affected. In both subgroup analyses, collagenase remained dominated.LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of the review was the lack of head-to-head RCTs comparing collagenase with surgery and the limited evidence base for estimating the effects of specific surgical procedures (fasciectomy and PNF). Substantial differences across studies further limited the comparability of available evidence. The economic model was derived from a naive indirect comparison and was hindered by a lack of suitable data. In addition, there was considerable uncertainty about the appropriateness of many assumptions and parameters used in the model.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase was significantly better than placebo. There was no evidence that collagenase was clinically better or worse than surgical treatments. LF was the most cost-effective choice to treat moderate to severe contractures, whereas collagenase was not. However, the results of the cost-utility analysis are based on a naive indirect comparison of clinical effectiveness, and a RCT is required to confirm or refute these findings.STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42013006248.FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.","Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",26524616,2015
Wnt pathway in Dupuytren disease: connecting profibrotic signals.,"A role of Wnt signaling in Dupuytren disease, a fibroproliferative disease of the hand and fingers, has not been fully elucidated. We examined a large set of Wnt pathway components and signaling targets and found significant dysregulation of 41 Wnt-related genes in tissue from the Dupuytren nodules compared with patient-matched control tissue. A large proportion of genes coding for Wnt proteins themselves was downregulated. However, both canonical Wnt targets and components of the noncanonical signaling pathway were upregulated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that protein expression of Wnt1-inducible secreted protein 1 (WISP1), a known Wnt target, was increased in nodules compared with control tissue, but knockdown of WISP1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the Dupuytren myofibroblasts did not confirm a functional role. The protein expression of noncanonical pathway components Wnt5A and VANGL2 as well as noncanonical coreceptors Ror2 and Ryk was increased in nodules. On the contrary, the strongest downregulated genes in this study were 4 antagonists of Wnt signaling (DKK1, FRZB, SFRP1, and WIF1). Downregulation of these genes in the Dupuytren tissue was mimicked in vitro by treating normal fibroblasts with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), suggesting cross talk between different profibrotic pathways. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of these antagonists in normal fibroblasts led to increased nuclear translocation of Wnt target β-catenin in response to TGF-β1 treatment. In conclusion, we have shown extensive dysregulation of Wnt signaling in affected tissue from Dupuytren disease patients. Components of both the canonical and the noncanonical pathways are upregulated, whereas endogenous antagonists are downregulated, possibly via interaction with other profibrotic pathways.",Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,26470681,2015
Risk of Hand Syndromes in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: A Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.,"The aim of this study was to assess the overall and cause-specific incidences of diabetic hand syndromes (DHS) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) by using age and sex stratifications.The DM and control cohorts comprised 606,152 patients with DM and 609,970 age- and sex-matched subjects, respectively, who were followed up from 2000 to 2008. We estimated the incidence densities (IDs) of overall and cause-specific DHS, namely carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (SFT), limited joint mobility (LJM), and Dupuytren disease (DD), and calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) of DHS in relation to DM by using a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for potential confounders.Over a 9-year period, 51,207 patients with DM (8.45%) and 39,153 matched controls (6.42%) sought ambulatory care visits for various DHS, with an ID of 117.7 and 80.7 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The highest cause-specific ID was observed for CTS, followed by SFT, LJM, and DD, regardless of the diabetic status. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with DM had a significantly high HR of overall DHS (1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-1.53). Men and women aged &lt;35 years had the highest HR (2.64, 95% CI = 2.15-3.24 and 2.99, 95% CI = 2.55-3.50, respectively). Cause-specific analyses revealed that DM was more strongly associated with SFT (HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.86-1.95) and DD (HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.39-2.39) than with CTS (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.28-1.34) and LJM (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.13-1.35).Men and younger patients with DM have the highest risk of DHS. Certain hand syndromes, such as SFT and DD, were more strongly associated with DM than with other syndromes and require the attention of clinicians. ",Medicine,26469895,2015
YAP1 Is a Driver of Myofibroblast Differentiation in Normal and Diseased Fibroblasts.,"Dupuytren disease is a fibrotic disorder characterized by contraction of myofibroblast-rich cords and nodules in the hands. The Hippo member Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is activated by tissue stiffness and the profibrotic transforming growth factor-β1, but its role in cell fibrogenesis is yet unclear. We hypothesized that YAP1 regulates the differentiation of dermal fibroblasts into highly contractile myofibroblasts and that YAP1 governs the maintenance of a myofibroblast phenotype in primary Dupuytren cells. Knockdown of YAP1 in transforming growth factor-β1-stimulated dermal fibroblasts decreased the formation of contractile smooth muscle α-actin stress fibers and the deposition of collagen type I, which are hallmark features of myofibroblasts. Translating our findings to a clinically relevant model, we found that YAP1 deficiency in Dupuytren disease myofibroblasts resulted in decreased expression of ACTA2, COL1A1, and CCN2 mRNA, but this did not result in decreased protein levels. YAP1-deficient Dupuytren myofibroblasts showed decreased contraction of a collagen hydrogel. Finally, we showed that YAP1 levels and nuclear localization were elevated in affected Dupuytren disease tissue compared with matched control tissue and partly co-localized with smooth muscle α-actin-positive cells. In conclusion, our data show that YAP1 is a regulator of myofibroblast differentiation and contributes to the maintenance of a synthetic and contractile phenotype, in both transforming growth factor-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and primary Dupuytren myofibroblasts.

RNA sequencing reveals a depletion of collagen targeting microRNAs in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is an inherited disorder in which patients develop fibrotic contractures of the hand. Current treatment strategies include surgical excision or enzymatic digestion of fibrotic tissue. MicroRNAs, which are key posttranscriptional regulators of genes expression, have been shown to play an important regulatory role in disorders of fibrosis. Therefore in this investigation, we apply high throughput next generation RNA sequencing strategies to characterize microRNA expression in diseased and healthy palmar fascia to elucidate molecular mechanisms responsible for pathogenic fibrosis.METHODS: We applied high throughput RNA sequencing techniques to quantify the expression of all known human microRNAs in Dupuytren's and control palmar fascia. MicroRNAs that were differentially expressed between diseased and healthy tissue samples were used for computational target prediction using the bioinformatics tool ComiR. Molecular pathways that were predicted to be differentially expressed based on computational analysis were validated by performing RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from diseased and non-diseased palmar fascia biopsies.RESULTS: A comparison of microRNAs expressed in Dupuytren's fascia and control fascia identified 74 microRNAs with a 2-fold enrichment in Dupuytren's tissue, and 32 microRNAs with enrichment in control fascia. Computational target prediction for differentially expressed microRNAs indicated preferential targeting of collagens and extracellular matrix related proteins in control palmar fascia. RT-qPCR confirmed the decreased expression of microRNA targeted collagens in control palmar fascia tissues.DISCUSSION: Control palmar fascia show decreased expression of mRNAs encoding collagens that are preferentially targeted by microRNAs enriched in non-diseased fascia. Thus alterations in microRNA regulatory networks may play an important role in driving the pathogenic fibrosis seen in Dupuytren's disease via direct regulatory effects on extracellular matrix protein synthesis.CONCLUSION: Dupuytren's fascia and healthy palmar fascia can be distinguished by unique microRNA profiles, which are predicted to preferentially target collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins.",BMC medical genomics,26446724,2015

Comparison between Collagenase Injection and Partial Fasciectomy in the Treatment of Dupuytren's Contracture.,"BACKGROUND: A comparative study between two treatment methods (collagenase injection and open partial fasciectomy) for Dupuytren's contracture. This study will determine differences in clinical outcome, complication rate and patient satisfaction.METHODS: 37 patients with 62 metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) and 44 proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) treated. There were 21 MCP joints (34%) and 8 PIP joints (18%) treated with injection. The remaining 66% of MCP joints and 82% of PIP joints were treated by open partial fasciectomy.RESULTS: Overall, both treatment methods were successful in correcting the passive extension deficit in the MCP and PIP joints. Minor complications were reported in 45% of patients in the injection group versus 42% in the surgery group. Patient satisfaction was nearly equal for both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment options have proven their effectiveness in treating Dupuytren's contracture. Open surgery is able to address additional joint contracture problems commonly associated with Dupuytren's disease.

Skin involvement in Dupuytren's disease.,"Whether the palmar skin has a role in the development, propagation or recurrence of Dupuytren's disease remains unclear. Clinical assessment for skin involvement is difficult and its correlation with histology uncertain. We prospectively biopsied the palmar skin of consecutive patients undergoing single digit fasciectomy (for primary Dupuytren's disease without clinically involved skin) and dermofasciectomy (for clinically involved skin or recurrence) in order to investigate this relationship. We found dermal fibromatosis in 22 of 44 patients (50%) undergoing fasciectomy and 41 of 59 patients (70%) undergoing dermofasciectomy. Dermal fibromatosis appeared to be associated with greater preoperative angular deformity, presence of palmar nodules and occupations involving manual labour. Dermal fibromatosis exists in the absence of clinical features of skin involvement and we hypothesize that the skin may have a greater role in the development and propagation of Dupuytren's disease than previously thought.</AbstractText>: Whether the palmar skin has a role in the development, propagation or recurrence of Dupuytren's disease remains unclear.

The quantitative role of flexor sheath incision in correcting Dupuytren proximal interphalangeal joint contractures.,"Controversy exists regarding intra-operative treatment of residual proximal interphalangeal joint contractures after Dupuytren's fasciectomy. We test the hypothesis that a simple release of the digital flexor sheath can correct residual fixed flexion contracture after subtotal fasciectomy. We prospectively enrolled 19 patients (22 digits) with Dupuytren's contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The average pre-operative extension deficit of the proximal interphalangeal joints was 58° (range 30-90). The flexion contracture of the joint was corrected to an average of 28° after fasciectomy. In most digits (20 of 21), subsequent incision of the flexor sheath further corrected the contracture by an average of 23°, resulting in correction to an average flexion contracture of 4.7° (range 0-40). Our results support that contracture of the tendon sheath is a contributor to Dupuytren's contracture of the joint and that sheath release is a simple, low morbidity addition to correct Dupuytren's contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Additional release of the proximal interphalangeal joint after fasciectomy, after release of the flexor sheath, is not necessary in many patients.</AbstractText>: Controversy exists regarding intra-operative treatment of residual proximal interphalangeal joint contractures after Dupuytren's fasciectomy.

New insights into the immediate outcome of collagenase injections for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is now established as an effective and safe option to treat patients with a single joint affected with Dupuytren's contracture. We have extended its use to natatory and combined cords. In a prospective consecutive series of 298 cords in 237 patients, the mean total extension loss improved in cords crossing the metacarpophalangeal joint from 46° to 1°, in cords crossing the proximal interphalangeal joint from 56° to 7°, in natatory cords from 130° to 25° and in combined cords from 102° to 16°. The immediate correction of combined cords and natatory cords was less reliable than that obtained in cords crossing the metacarpophalangeal joint or proximal interphalangeal joint. Less severe pre-intervention contractures tended to correct better. We found a high complication rate, which may cause alarm. A total of 21% developed skin splits, with the risk of skin splits generally increasing with more severe pre-injection deformity. Blood blisters were only encountered after manipulation of the more severe contractures. A total of 23 patients (8%) had a spontaneous rupture and 57 patients (19%) had a partial spontaneous rupture. Only 4.9% needed a second injection. We noticed a learning curve, with seven of the first 20 cords (35%) needing a second injection to achieve a satisfactory correction and then only seven (2.5%) in the rest.</AbstractText>: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is now established as an effective and safe option to treat patients with a single joint affected with Dupuytren's contracture.

[Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's disease].,"OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous transverse aponeurotomy of the cord by using a hypodermic needle as a scalpel blade in order to improve function of the hand.INDICATIONS: Symptomatic flexion contracture with positive table top test caused by a single, palpable cord within the palm (primarily Tubiana stages I and II).CONTRAINDICATIONS: Multiple, infiltrating or broad-based cords within the palm; irritated skin conditions; exclusive digital cord localization; recurrence after aponeurectomy; previous surgical intervention at the site of interest, digital nerve lesions; lack of patient compliance.SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Pinpoint surface anesthesia is obtained by injecting each portal area subdermally with 0.1 ml of local anesthetic. These applications start from distally to proximally within the palm while the most distal injection site is located proximal to the distal palm crease. Then the needle tip is introduced perpendicular to the cord. Sawing movements through the cord are performed transversely. While passively extending the contracted finger, the cord is held under tension which guarantees safe cutting. Patients are encouraged to report immediate pain sensation or numbness in order to prevent injuries to neurovascular structures and active finger flexion excludes tendon lesions during the procedure. Introducing the needle tip may be performed at several sites along the cord, if necessary, from distal to proximal at least 5 mm apart with prior pinpoint surface anesthesia. Finally, cautious passive stretching may be done after each release.POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Bandaging allowing immediate motion; application of a hand-based extension splint-glove during the night for 3-6 months.RESULTS: Recurrence rate was 53% in 15 retrospectively examined patients after a mean interval of 40 months postoperatively.",Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,26303259,2015

"The Efficacy and Safety of Concurrent Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Injections for 2 Dupuytren Contractures in the Same Hand: A Prospective, Multicenter Study.","PURPOSE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of concurrent administration of 2 collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injections to treat 2 joints in the same hand with Dupuytren fixed flexion contractures (FFCs).METHODS: Patients with 2 or more contractures in the same hand caused by palpable cords participated in a 60-day, multicenter, open-label, phase 3b study. Two 0.58 mg CCH doses were injected into 1 or 2 cords in the same hand (1 injection per affected joint) during the same visit. Finger extension was performed approximately 24, 48, or 72 or more hours later. Changes in FFC and range of motion, incidence of clinical success (FFC ≤ 5°), and adverse events (AEs) were summarized.RESULTS: The study enrolled 715 patients (725 treated joint pairs), and 714 patients (724 joint pairs) were analyzed for efficacy. At day 31, mean total FFC (sum of 2 treated joints) decreased 74%, from 98° to 27°. Mean total range of motion increased from 90° to 156°. The incidence of clinical success was 65% in metacarpophalangeal joints and 29% in proximal interphalangeal joints. Most treatment-related AEs were mild to moderate, resolving without intervention; the most common were swelling of treated extremity, contusion, and pain in extremity. The incidence of skin lacerations was 22% (160 of 715). Efficacy and safety were similar regardless of time to finger extension.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum can be used to effectively treat 2 affected joints concurrently without a greater risk of AEs than treatment of a single joint, with the exception of skin laceration. The incidence of clinical success in this study after 1 injection per joint was comparable to phase 3 study results after 3 or more injections per joint. Two concurrent CCH injections may allow more rapid overall treatment of multiple affected joints, and the ability to vary the time between CCH injection and finger extension may allow physicians and patients greater flexibility with scheduling treatment.",The Journal of hand surgery,26216077,2015
Involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture: a novel target for a possible future therapeutic strategy?,"Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a benign fibro-proliferative disease of the hand causing fibrotic nodules and fascial cords which determine debilitating contracture and deformities of fingers and hands. The present study was designed to characterize pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis, progression and recurrence of this disease, in order to find novel targets for alternative therapies and strategies in controlling DC. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of growth factors was detected by immunohistochemistry in fibrotic nodules and normal palmar fascia resected respectively from patients affected by DC and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS; as negative controls). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis and immunofluorescence were performed to quantify the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-1β and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by primary cultures of myofibroblasts and fibroblasts isolated from Dupuytren's nodules. Histological analysis showed high cellularity and high proliferation rate in Dupuytren's tissue, together with the presence of myofibroblastic isotypes; immunohistochemical staining for macrophages was completely negative. In addition, a strong expression of TGF-β1, IL-1β and VEGF was evident in the extracellular matrix and in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in Dupuytren's nodular tissues, as compared with control tissues. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence in pathological and normal primary cell cultures. These preliminary observations suggest that TGF-β1, IL-1β and VEGF may be considered potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease (DD).

Joint Stiffness Is Heritable and Associated with Fibrotic Conditions and Joint Replacement.,"OBJECTIVE: Joint stiffness is a common, debilitating, age-related symptom, which may be seen after total joint replacement (TJR). Stiffness also occurs in fibrotic conditions such as shoulder capsulitis and Dupuytren's contracture. We speculated that the two traits (TJR and fibrotic disease) are linked pathogenically.METHODS: Using the TwinsUK NIHR BRC BioResource we tested the hypotheses that 1) joint (hip and knee) stiffness, TJR (hip and knee), and fibrotic conditions are associated and 2) genetic factors contribute to them.RESULTS: Participating twins (n = 9718) had completed self-reported questionnaires on the traits of interest. All three traits were significantly associated with increasing age and body mass index (BMI), as well as female sex, on univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between TJR and joint stiffness (OR = 3.96, 95% confidence interval, CI 2.77-5.68) and between fibrotic conditions and joint stiffness (OR = 2.39, 1.74-3.29), adjusting for age, sex, BMI and twin relatedness. Monozygotic versus dizygotic intraclass correlations gave heritability estimates for TJR = 46% and joint stiffness = 32%.CONCLUSION: That fibrotic conditions, joint stiffness and TJR are significantly associated suggests a common disease process, possibly fibrosis, which is genetically mediated.",PloS one,26197488,2015

Dupuytren's contractures associated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib: a case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Two previous cases of the development of Dupuytren's contractures were reported in association with BRAF inhibitor treatment for BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. We reported on a third case with a slower onset of presentation.CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old white man was diagnosed with a BRAF V600E mutated metastatic cutaneous melanoma. He was commenced on oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. A marked response was achieved for his metastatic disease. He noticed a change of his hair characteristics and a feeling of &quot;lumps&quot; in both palms by 6 months. By 9 months, classical Dupuytren's contracture was apparent.CONCLUSIONS: Dupuytren's contracture is not a known side effect of BRAF inhibitor treatment. The timeline for the development of Dupuytren's contracture on BRAF inhibitor treatment is not well defined. Although the etiology of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown, an increase in tumor necrosis factor has been demonstrated to be a possible mechanism. BRAF inhibition has been shown to increase immune reaction in the tumor microenvironment and is associated with high serum tumor necrosis factor level. We propose that an increased level of tumor necrosis factor associated with BRAF inhibition may increase the risk of the development of Dupuytren's contractures.",Journal of medical case reports,26152183,2015
Percutaneous Aponeurotomy and Lipofilling (PALF): A Regenerative Approach to Dupuytren Contracture.,"Dupuytren disease is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder, which leads to flexion contractures of the digits. A minimally invasive technique consisting of an extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy of the cord with a needle combined with lipofilling is presented. The selective cutting of the cords under continuous tension disintegrates the cords while sparing the looser neurovascular bundles. Subsequently, lipoaspirate is injected subcutaneously. The authors' prospective results show a significantly shorter recovery time and less overall complications in this technique when compared with open surgery, while no significant difference was observed in the extent of immediate contracture correction and in the recurrence rate at 1 year follow-up.

Dupuytren Contracture Recurrence Following Treatment With Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CORDLESS [Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren Long-Term Evaluation of Safety Study]): 5-Year Data.,"PURPOSE: Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren Long-Term Evaluation of Safety Study was a 5-year noninterventional follow-up study to determine long-term efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) treatment for Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: Patients from previous CCH clinical studies were eligible. Enrolled patients were evaluated annually for contracture and safety at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after their first injection (0.58 mg) of CCH. In successfully treated joints (≤ 5° contracture following CCH treatment), recurrence was defined as 20° or greater worsening (relative to day 30 after the last injection) with a palpable cord or any medical/surgical intervention to correct new/worsening contracture. A post hoc analysis was also conducted using a less stringent threshold (≥ 30° worsening) for comparison with criteria historically used to assess surgical treatment.RESULTS: Of 950 eligible patients, 644 enrolled (1,081 treated joints). At year 5, 47% (291 of 623) of successfully treated joints had recurrence (≥ 20° worsening)-39% (178 of 451) of metacarpophalangeal and 66% (113 of 172) of proximal interphalangeal joints. At year 5, 32% (198 of 623) of successfully treated joints had 30° or greater worsening (metacarpophalangeal 26% [119 of 451] and proximal interphalangeal 46% [79 of 172] joints). Of 105 secondary interventions performed in the successfully treated joints, 47% (49 of 105) received fasciectomy, 30% (32 of 105) received additional CCH, and 23% (24 of 105) received other interventions. One mild adverse event was attributed to CCH treatment (skin atrophy [decreased ring finger circumference from thinning of Dupuytren tissue]). Antibodies to clostridial type I and/or II collagenase were found in 93% of patients, but over the 5 years of follow-up, this did not correspond to any reported clinical adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: Five years after successful CCH treatment, the overall recurrence rate of 47% was comparable with published recurrence rates after surgical treatments, with one reported long-term treatment-related adverse event. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection proved to be an effective and safe treatment for Dupuytren contracture.

"Simultaneous Regional Fasciectomy, Skin Grafting, and Distraction Arthrolysis of the Proximal Interphalangeal Joint for Dupuytren's Contracture of the Little Finger.","We present a 58-year-old right-handed man, who consulted us with an 11-year history of Dupuytren's disease. To correct contracture of the little finger, we performed regional fasciectomy, skin grafting, and distraction arthrolysis of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint using an external fixator. Preoperative or postoperative skeletal traction has been advocated to treat potential or residual stiffness of the PIP joint in Dupuytren's contracture, but its intraoperative use has not been reported before. Our method has the advantage of treating each problem caused by Dupuytren's disease. A good range of painless PIP joint motion is achieved by our intraoperative distraction technique without interfering with the skin graft and without reducing extensor tone, while the healing period is shortened by performing all procedures simultaneously.

Critical Angles of Deformity in Dupuytren's Contracture of the Little and Ring Fingers.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the degree of contracture in the ring and little fingers at which hand function became importantly impaired.METHODS: Five activities of daily living were incorporated into a newly developed and validated Dupuytren's assessment tool (DAT). Sixty healthy participants were assessed with the DAT wearing a range of 12 dorsal blocking splints. Half wore them on their right little finger, the other half on their ring finger. These induced flexion deformities mimicking DC of the MCPJ, PIPJ and a combination of the two. The angles of flexion deformity at which important hand disability occurred were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves.RESULTS: Clinically important hand disability occurred for the little finger MCPJ, PIPJ and combined MCPJ and PIPJ angulation at 52.5, 67.5, and 75 degrees respectively. For the ring finger joint, the angulations were 52.5, 67.5 and 75 degrees respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This information will provide information for clinicians and patients as to when clinically important disability tends to occur in DC.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,26051771,2015
Developing an animal model of Dupuytren's disease by orthotopic transplantation of human fibroblasts into athymic rat.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a slow, progressive fibroproliferative disorder affecting the palms of the hands. The disease is characterized by the formation of collagen rich- cords which gradually shorten by the action of myofibroblasts resulting in finger contractures. It is a disease that is confined to humans, and a major limiting factor in investigating this disorder has been the lack of a faithful animal model that can recapitulate its distinct biology. The aim of this study was to develop such a model by determining if Dupuytren's disease (DD)- and control carpal tunnel (CT)-derived fibroblasts could survive in the forepaw of the nude rats and continue to exhibit the distinct characteristics they display in in vitro cultures.METHODS: 1x10(7) fluorescently labeled DD- and CT-derived fibroblasts were transplanted into the left and right forepaws of nude rats respectively. Cells were tracked at regular intervals for a period of two months by quantifying emitted fluorescent signal using an IVIS imaging system. After a period of 62 days rat forepaw connective tissues were harvested for histology and total RNA was isolated. Human-specific probes were used to perform real time RT-PCR assays to examine the expression patterns of gene products associated with fibrosis in DD. Rat forepaw skin was also harvested to serve as an internal control.RESULTS: Both CT- and DD-derived fibroblasts survived for a period of 62 days, but DD-derived cells showed a significantly greater level of persistent fluorescent signal at the end of this time than did CT-derived cells. mRNA expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), type I- and type III- collagens were all significantly elevated in the forepaw receiving DD cord-derived fibroblasts in comparison to CT-derived fibroblasts. Masson's trichrome stain confirmed increased collagen deposition in the forepaw that was injected with DD cord-derived fibroblasts.CONCLUSIONS: For the first time we describe an animal model for Dupuytren's disease at the orthotopic anatomical location. We further show that gene expression differences between control (CT) and diseased (DD) derived fibroblasts persist when these cells are transplanted to the forepaw of the nude rat. These preliminary findings indicate that, with further refinements, this animal model holds promise as a baseline for investigating novel therapeutic regimens to determine an effective strategy in treating DD.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,26049932,2015
Laminin-rich blood vessels display activated growth factor signaling and act as the proliferation centers in Dupuytren's contracture.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a chronic fibroproliferative disease of the hand, which is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of atypical myofibroblasts at the cellular level. We hypothesized that specific areas of the DC tissue are sustaining the cell proliferation and studied the potential molecular determinants that might contribute to the formation of such niches.METHODS: We studied the expression pattern of cell proliferation marker Ki67, phosphorylated AKT (Ak mouse strain thymoma) kinase, DC-associated growth factors (connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2)) and extracellular matrix components (laminins, fibronectin, collagen IV) in DC tissue and normal palmar fascia using immunofluorescence microscopy and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).RESULTS: We found that proliferative cells in the DC nodules were concentrated in the immediate vicinity of small blood vessels and localized predominantly in the myofibroblast layer. Correspondingly, the DC-associated blood vessels contained increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, a hallmark of activated growth factor signaling. When studying the expression of potential activators of AKT signaling we found that the expression of bFGF was confined to the endothelium of the small blood vessels, IGF-2 was present uniformly in the DC tissue and CTGF was expressed in the DC-associated sweat gland acini. In addition, the blood vessels in DC nodules contained increased amounts of laminins 511 and 521, which have been previously shown to promote the proliferation and stem cell properties of different cell types.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we propose that in the DC-associated small blood vessels the presence of growth factors in combination with favorable extracellular matrix composition provide a supportive environment for sustained proliferation of myofibroblasts and thus the blood vessels play an important role in DC pathogenesis.",Arthritis research &amp; therapy,26018562,2015
Salvage palmar fasciectomy after initial treatment with collagenase clostridium histolyticum.,"BACKGROUND: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was approved for clinical use in 2010 and has become an accepted treatment modality for Dupuytren's contracture. Because longitudinal experience with injectable collagenase remains limited, the effect of treatment on future surgery is not well defined.METHODS: A retrospective review of the senior author's practice from February of 2010 through March of 2014 was performed. Eleven patients were identified who had digital or palmar fasciectomy after at least one previous injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum. Cases were reviewed for functional outcomes and operative difficulty.RESULTS: Seven metacarpophalangeal joints and 12 proximal interphalangeal joints in 11 patients were treated. Nine of the 11 patients were referred to the senior author after collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections by other hand surgeons; two patients had previous injections by the senior author. The average interval between most recent injection and salvage fasciectomy was 12 months. Intraoperative findings demonstrated disruption of normal architecture and areolar tissue, with extensive scar in the dissection planes after previous injection. Mean preoperative/postinjection joint contracture for metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints was 42 and 60 degrees, respectively; after surgery, joint contractures were 0 and 21 degrees, respectively. Significant improvement in postoperative range of motion was seen for both metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints after palmar fasciectomy.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections may produce a deeply scarred bed and increase the technical difficulty of salvage fasciectomy. However, results of palmar fasciectomy are comparable to those of primary fasciectomy even in the setting of recurrent or progressive disease.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,26017606,2015

Explanatory variables: range of motion of the finger joints, five questions regarding safety and social issues of hand function, and health-related quality of life (Euroqol).RESULTS: The three variables &quot;need to take special precautions&quot;, &quot;avoid using the hand in social context&quot;, and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index) explained 62.1% of the variance in DASH, where the first variable had the greatest relative effect.DISCUSSION: Safety and social issues of hand function and quality of life had an evident association with functional recovery.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,25998546,2015
Ultrasound-Assisted Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy for Dupuytren's Contracture.,"Although percutaneous needle fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture is a simple, inexpensive procedure, it is a blind procedure with risks including injury to nerves, arteries, and tendons. The authors describe a novel technique using ultrasound as an adjunct to percutaneous fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture. Generally, patients have no postoperative restrictions other than to avoid submerging their hands for 48 hours. To date, the authors have noted, in 66 cases, no permanent complete nerve dysfunction following needle aponeurotomy using ultrasound assistance. Recurrence of the disease is the most common complication, occurring at a higher rate than with open procedures. Ultrasound mapping of the digital neurovascular structures can be successfully used as an adjunct to help prevent these neurovascular complications.",Orthopedics,25970356,2015
Screening of candidate genes in fibroblasts derived from patients with Dupuytren's contracture using bioinformatics analysis.,"Our study aimed to identify candidate genes associated with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and elucidate their roles in DC development. The microarray data of GSE21221 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, including six samples from carpal tunnel-derived fibroblasts and six samples from DC-derived fibroblasts. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DC samples were screened using limma package. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses were performed by DAVID online tool. Protein-protein interaction network and expression correlation network were constructed to identify crucial relationships between DEGs. Finally, candidate DC-associated genes were predicted based on comparative toxicogenomics database. A total of 529 DEGs (138 up- and 391 down-regulated) in DC-derived fibroblasts were screened and compared with carpal tunnel-derived fibroblasts. Only ten DC-associated genes, such as neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) and protein kinase C, epsilon (PRKCE), were further screened. In addition, NTF3 was significantly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway, in which other DEGs, such as nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (NR4A1), fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) and BDNF, were enriched. Besides, NTF3 could co-express with fibrillin 2 (FBN2), and PRKCE could co-express with zinc finger protein 516 (ZNF516), solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 2A1 (SLCO2A1), chromosome 10 open reading frame 10 (C10orf10) and Kelch domain containing 7A (KLHDC7A). Our study indicates that these DEGs, including NTF3, FBN2, NR4A1, FGF22, BDNF, PRKCE, ZNF516, SLCO2A1, C10orf10 and KLHDC7A, may play important roles in DC development and serve as candidate molecular targets for treating DC.

Human Dupuytren's Ex Vivo Culture for the Study of Myofibroblasts and Extracellular Matrix Interactions.,"Organ fibrosis or &quot;scarring&quot; is known to account for a high death toll due to the extensive amount of disorders and organs affected (from cirrhosis to cardiovascular diseases). There is no effective treatment and the in vitro tools available do not mimic the in vivo situation rendering the progress of the out of control wound healing process still enigmatic. To date, 2D and 3D cultures of fibroblasts derived from DD patients are the main experimental models available. Primary cell cultures have many limitations; the fibroblasts derived from DD are altered by the culture conditions, lack cellular context and interactions, which are crucial for the development of fibrosis and weakly represent the derived tissue. Real-time PCR analysis of fibroblasts derived from control and DD samples show that little difference is detectable. 3D cultures of fibroblasts include addition of extracellular matrix that alters the native conditions of these cells. As a way to characterize the fibrotic, proliferative properties of these resection specimens we have developed a 3D culture system, using intact human resections of the nodule part of the cord. The system is based on transwell plates with an attached nitrocellulose membrane that allows contact of the tissue with the medium but not with the plastic, thus, preventing the alteration of the tissue. No collagen gel or other extracellular matrix protein substrate is required. The tissue resection specimens maintain their viability and proliferative properties for 7 days. This is the first &quot;organ&quot; culture system that allows human resection specimens from DD patients to be grown ex vivo and functionally tested, recapitulating the in vivo situation.

Management of complications of Dupuytren contracture.,"This evidence-based article discusses the current management options of Dupuytren disease and strategies to avoid and manage any potential complications. Treatment options include fasciectomy, needle fasciotomy/aponeurotomy, and collagenase injection. Complications include digital nerve and artery injury, flexor tendon injury, skin fissures and wound healing complications, hematoma, infection, flare reaction/complex regional pain syndrome, and recurrence. Complication rates, prevention, and management differ with each treatment modality. A detailed understanding of each of these options allows hand surgeons to select the most appropriate treatment for each patient. ",Hand clinics,25934208,2015
Epidemiological profile of Dupuytren's disease in Taiwan (Ethnic Chinese): a nationwide population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiologic profile of ethnic Chinese patients with Dupuytren's disease is unknown. We therefore investigated the epidemiology of Dupuytren's disease using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.METHODS: Patients who filed claims for treatment for Dupuytren's disease between January 2000 and December 2011 were identified in the database. Age- and gender-specific incidences were estimated by dividing the incidence number by population data.RESULTS: We identified 1,078 patients with Dupuytren's disease (681 men, 397 women; male/female ratio: 1:1.72). The annual incidence rate ranged from 0.39-0.63/10(5) for men and 0.14-0.44/10(5) for women. A trend analysis revealed a rising trend in the annual incidence from 2001 to 2011 (p = 0.0199). The prevalence rate increased steadily from 0.46/10(5) in 2000 to 4.52/10(5) in 2011 (p = 0.0186). The mean age at onset was significantly higher in men than in women (60.7 ± 18.4 vs. 53.7 ± 15.5 years). Peak age at onset for men was 70-79 (28.1%) and for women was 50-59 (33.5%). Men &gt; 60 years old had higher incidence rates than did women (incidence rate ratios: 2.0, 4.5, and 6.6 for those 60-69, 70-79, and ≥ 80, respectively). Hypertension (29.6%), diabetes mellitus (21.9%), hyperlipidemia (14.8%), ischemic heart disease (10.5%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8.0%) were the most common comorbidities.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of Dupuytren's disease and the male/female ratio were significantly lower in ethnic Chinese than in Western ethnic groups. Moreover, the age at onset was significantly lower in ethnic Chinese women. However, the incidences of three comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia) were similar to those in other ethnicities.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,25881036,2015
Impact on costs of switching one-ray aponeurectomy to percutaneous needle aponeurotomy in Dupuytren's disease: A model analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost of switching surgical aponeurectomy to percutaneous needle aponeurotomy in one-ray Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: A model analysis was performed with a cross-sectional national survey of public and private French hospitals in 2012. All stays for one-ray aponeurectomy were &quot;virtually&quot; replaced with 1, 2 or 3 outpatient sessions of percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. The costs were based on the hospital cost (tariff per disease-related group) and on common classification of medical procedures performed in outpatient care for 2013.RESULTS: Dupuytren's disease represented 18,707 hospitalizations (€26 million [2013 euros]) in France in 2012, 8534 hospitalizations for one-ray aponeurectomy (€11.9 million). By replacing surgical aponeurectomy with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for one-ray Dupuytren's disease, 91% to 97% and 56% to 59% of the treatment costs could be saved using hospitalizations for one-ray aponeurectomy or total hospital costs, respectively, as reference.CONCLUSIONS: Replacing aponeurectomy with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for one-ray Dupuytren's disease could greatly reduce the treatment costs for all Dupuytren's disease. Effective alternatives to surgery for Dupuytren's disease, such as needle aponeurotomy in an outpatient setting should be considered in the economic perspective.","Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",25857217,2015
Prevalence of palmar fibromatosis with and without contracture in asymptomatic patients.,"BACKGROUND: This retrospective study documents the proportion of hand clinic patients presenting with palmar fibromatosis with and without contracture.METHODS: All &quot;new&quot; patients &gt;18 years presenting to a single surgeon's hand clinic over a 16-month period were included, and information was abstracted from chart review regarding patient demographics, reason for presentation, presence or absence of palmar fibromatosis, contracture, and prior known diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease. The percentage of asymptomatic patients with palmar fibromatosis was calculated.RESULTS: Of 827 patients, 306 had palmar fibromatosis. Among all patients, 33% of male and 40% of female patients had palmar fibromatosis. Only 8% had contractures, while 92% had palmar fibromatosis without contracture. Among those who had contractures, 81% presented with a primary complaint of Dupuytren's disease (symptomatic contracture). Prevalence of palmar fibromatosis increased with increasing age.CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that Dupuytren's palmar fibromatosis is common and often present without overt contractures.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,25854281,2015
Efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum in the treatment of proximal interphalangeal joints in dupuytren contracture: combined analysis of 4 phase 3 clinical trials.,"PURPOSE: To examine the results of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures from 4 phase 3 clinical trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection for Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: Patients enrolled in Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren I/II and JOINT I/II with one or more PIP joint contractures (20° to 80°) received CCH 0.58 mg/0.20 mL or placebo (Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren I/II only) injected directly into a palpable cord. The percentage of PIP joints achieving clinical success (0° to 5° of full extension), clinical improvement (50% or more reduction in baseline contracture), and range of motion improvement at 30 days after the first and last CCH injections was assessed. The PIP joint contractures were classified into low (40° or less) and high (more than 40°) baseline severity. Adverse events were recorded.RESULTS: A total of 506 adults (mean age, 63 ± 10 y; 80% male) received 1,165 CCH injections in 644 PIP joint cords (mean, 1.6 injections/cord). Most patients (60%) received 1 injection, with 24%, 16%, and 1% receiving 2, 3, and 4 injections, respectively. Clinical success and clinical improvement occurred in 27% and 49% of PIP joints after one injection and in 34% and 58% after the last injection. Patients with lower baseline severity showed greater improvement and response was comparable between fingers, as were improvements in range of motion. Adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients were peripheral edema (58%), contusion (38%), injection site hemorrhage (23%), injection site pain (21%), injection site swelling (16%), and tenderness (13%). This incidence was consistent with data reported in phase 3 trials. Two tendon ruptures occurred. No further ruptures occurred after a modified injection technique was adopted.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was effective and well tolerated in the short term in patients with Dupuytren PIP joint contractures.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.",The Journal of hand surgery,25843533,2015
Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum versus Limited Fasciectomy for Dupuytren's Contracture: Outcomes from a Multicenter Propensity Score Matched Study.,"BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about the relative effectiveness of injectable collagenase (collagenase clostridium histolyticum) and limited fasciectomy in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. The authors compared the effectiveness of both techniques in actual clinical practice.METHODS: This study evaluated all subjects treated with collagenase clostridium histolyticum or limited fasciectomy for metacarpophalangeal and/or proximal interphalangeal joint contractures between 2011 and 2014 at seven practice sites. The authors compared the degree of residual contracture (active extension deficit), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire scores, and adverse events at follow-up visits occurring between 6 and 12 weeks after surgery or the last injection with the use of propensity score matching.RESULTS: In 132 matched subjects who were treated with collagenase (n = 66) or fasciectomy (n = 66), the degree of residual contracture at follow-up for affected metacarpophalangeal joints was not significantly different (13 degrees versus 6 degrees; p = 0.095) and affected proximal interphalangeal joints had significantly worse residual contracture in the collagenase group compared with those in the fasciectomy group (25 degrees versus 15 degrees; p = 0.010). Collagenase subjects experienced fewer serious adverse events than did fasciectomy subjects and reported larger improvements in the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire subscores evaluating satisfaction with hand function, activities of daily living, and work performance.CONCLUSIONS: This propensity score-matched study showed that collagenase clostridium histolyticum was not significantly different from limited fasciectomy in reducing metacarpophalangeal joint contractures, whereas proximal interphalangeal joint contractures showed slightly better reduction following limited fasciectomy. Collagenase provided a more rapid recovery of hand function than did fasciectomy and was associated with fewer serious adverse events.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,25829153,2015
[Dupuytren's disease treatment].,"Dupuytren's disease is a hereditary fibroproliferative disease commonly affecting the palmar fascia of the hand, which results in progressive and irreversibly fixed flexion contractures of the hand. It may occur in the sole of the foot or in the penis. Generally, treatment has been up against a high frequency of complications and recurrence, but promising results are reported from less invasive treatment options, e.g. needle fasciotomy and enzymatic fasciotomy with collagenase.

Treatment of proximal interphalangeal joint flexion contracture: combined static and dynamic orthotic intervention compared with other therapy intervention: a randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: To test the effectiveness of static and dynamic orthoses using them as an exclusive treatment for proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion contracture compared with other hand therapy conservative treatments described in the literature.METHODS: 60 patients who used orthoses were compared with a control group that received other hand therapy treatments. Clinical assessments were measured before the experiment and 3 months after and included active PIP joint extension and function.RESULTS: A significant improvement in the extension active range of motion at the PIP joint in the second measurement was found in both groups, but it was significantly greater in the experimental group. Improvement in function (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score) between the first and second assessment was similar in the control and experimental groups.CONCLUSIONS: Using night progressive static and daily dynamic orthoses as an exclusive treatment during the proliferative phase led to significant improvements in the PIP joint active extension, but the improvement did not correlate with increased function as perceived by the patient.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.",The Journal of hand surgery,25771480,2015
Identification and function analysis of contrary genes in Dupuytren's contracture.,"The present study aimed to analyze the expression of genes involved in Dupuytren's contracture (DC), using bioinformatic methods. The profile of GSE21221 was downloaded from the gene expression ominibus, which included six samples, derived from fibroblasts and six healthy control samples, derived from carpal-tunnel fibroblasts. A Distributed Intrusion Detection System was used in order to identify differentially expressed genes. The term contrary genes is proposed. Contrary genes were the genes that exhibited opposite expression patterns in the positive and negative groups, and likely exhibited opposite functions. These were identified using Coexpress software. Gene ontology (GO) function analysis was conducted for the contrary genes. A network of GO terms was constructed using the reduce and visualize gene ontology database. Significantly expressed genes (801) and contrary genes (98) were screened. A significant association was observed between Chitinase-3-like protein 1 and ten genes in the positive gene set. Positive regulation of transcription and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inducing kinase activity exhibited the highest degree values in the network of GO terms. In the present study, the expression of genes involved in the development of DC was analyzed, and the concept of contrary genes proposed. The genes identified in the present study are involved in the positive regulation of transcription and activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase activity. The contrary genes and GO terms identified in the present study may potentially be used for DC diagnosis and treatment.",Molecular medicine reports,25760233,2015
Pearls and pitfalls of needle aponeurotomy in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a benign, progressive, fibroproliferative disease, and despite advances in basic science and technology, there remains no cure. To date, open fasciectomy procedures remain the criterion standard for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease despite a significant complication rate and recovery time. Needle aponeurotomy, a less invasive treatment, is associated with reduced complications and quicker recovery.METHODS: A literature review and a compilation of over 700 procedures was performed to highlight the clinical relevance of needle aponeurotomy. A step-by-step description of the author's technique for needle aponeurotomy is presented, emphasizing the pearls and pitfalls of the procedure.RESULTS: Recurrence rates for open fasciectomy are 5 to 10 percent per year compared with rates for needle aponeurotomy, which are 10 to 20 percent per year. Overall complication rates are much less frequent with needle aponeurotomy, with skin tears being the most common (3 percent). Needle aponeurotomy is cost effective compared with open fasciectomy. Recurrent proximal interphalangeal joint flexion contractures remain the most problematic in terms of correction.CONCLUSIONS: Needle aponeurotomy has been shown to be an extremely useful adjunct available to the surgeon in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. This procedure can be performed easily in an outpatient setting or office and carries with it dramatic results. Needle aponeurotomy has a lower complication rate and quicker recovery when compared with open fasciectomy and is therefore offered to patients as a first-line treatment.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,25719700,2015
"Collagenase treatment of Dupuytren's contracture using a modified injection method: a prospective cohort study of skin tears in 164 hands, including short-term outcome.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture (DC) with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) consists of injection followed by finger manipulation. We used a modified method, injecting a higher dose than recommended on the label into several parts of the cord, which allows treatment of multiple joint contractures in 1 session and may increase efficacy. We studied the occurrence of skin tears and short-term outcome with this procedure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 164 consecutive hands with DC, palpable cord, and extension deficit of ≥ 20º in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (mean patient age 70 years, 82% men). A hand surgeon injected all the content of 1 CCH vial (approximately 0.80 mg) into multiple spots in the cord and performed finger extension under local anesthesia after 1 or 2 days. A nurse recorded skin tears on a diagram and conducted a standard telephone follow-up within 4 weeks. A hand therapist measured joint contracture before injection and at a median of 23 (IQR: 7-34) days after finger extension.RESULTS: A skin tear occurred in 66 hands (40%). The largest diameter of the tear was ≤ 5 mm in 30 hands and &gt; 10 mm in 14 hands. Hands with skin tear had greater mean pretreatment MCP extension deficit than those without tear: 59º (SD 26) as opposed to 32º (SD 23). Skin tear occurred in 21 of 24 hands with MCP contracture of ≥ 75º. All tears healed with open-wound treatment. No infections occurred. Mean improvement in total (MCP + PIP) extension deficit was 55º (SD 28).INTERPRETATION: Skin tears occurred in 40% of hands treated with collagenase injections, but only a fifth of them were larger than 1 cm. Tears were more likely in hands with severe MCP joint contracture. All tears healed without complications. Short-term contracture reduction was good.",Acta orthopaedica,25695745,2015
"Intra- and inter-observer agreement on diagnosis of Dupuytren disease, measurements of severity of contracture, and disease extent.","INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren disease (DD) is a fibrosing disease affecting the palmar aponeurosis, and is mostly treated by surgery based on measurement of severity of flexion contracture of the fingers. Literature concerning the measurement reliability is scarce. This study aimed to determine the intra- and inter-observer agreement of four variables for diagnosing DD, determining severity of contracture, and disease extent. One of them is a new measurement on the area of nodules and cords for measuring the disease extent in early disease stages.METHODS: An agreement study (n = 54) was performed by two trained investigators. Agreement was calculated per finger, based on an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using a latent variable model on subjects for diagnosis and Tubiana stage. For total passive extension deficit (TPED) and the area of nodules and cords, agreement was calculated with an ICC using a one-way random effects model with subject as random effect.RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement was very good for diagnosing DD (ICC: 95.5%-99.9%) and good to very good for classifying Tubiana stage (ICC: 73.5%-94.9%). Agreements for area and TPED were moderate (middle finger) to very good (ICC: 48.4%-98.6% and 45.0%-99.5%, respectively). Intra-observer agreement was slightly higher on average than inter-observer agreement.CONCLUSION: Overall, the intra- and inter-observer agreement in diagnosing DD, and determining the severity of flexion contracture is high. Also, the newly introduced variable area of nodules and cords has high intra- and inter-observer agreement, indicating that it is suitable to measure disease extent.",Manual therapy,25682557,2015
[Manifestation of Dupuytren nodules following fracture of the distal radius].,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of post-traumatic development of Dupuytren nodules in distal radius fractures treated operatively.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2 prospective randomised studies for operative treatment of distal radius fractures, the formation of Dupuytren nodules was registered. One of the exclusion criteria was a pre-existing Dupuytren's disease at the date of trauma. In addition to the notification of the development of Dupuytren nodules, signs of a complex regional pain syndrome were registered as well as the wrist function, level of pain and grip strength. The Castaing and the Gartland and Werley scores were assessed. The clinical outcomes of patients with and without Dupuytren nodules were compared. 239 of 275 (87%) of the patients could be examined 1 year after the operation, consisting of 32 men and 207 women with a median age of 64.2 years. The patients with Dupuytren nodules were re-evaluated after 16-60 months (median 41.8) for progression of the disease.RESULTS: 21 patients (8.7%) developed changes of the palmar aponeurosis. In 20 patients nodules were stated, one patient showed a cord at the fourth ray of the injured hand. 19 out of 21 patients were female (90.5%). At re-evaluation after 41.8 months (16-60) progression could not be noted nor could similar changes be seen on the contralateral side. Patients with Dupuytren nodules were not handicapped in their hand function. 3 patients (14.3%) revealed a positive family history for Dupuytren's disease. Abuse of alcohol or diabetes was not present in any of the patients with Dupuytren nodules, 7 (33%) were smokers.CONCLUSION: The occurrence of Dupyutren nodules can be triggered by a trauma or operation. It may be speculated that these nodules are an entity of their own as no progression of the contracture could be seen during the follow-up period.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",25671757,2015
A review of the classification of Dupuytren's disease.,"Although much has been published about the treatment of Dupuytren's disease, there is no clear consensus regarding the most effective form of treatment. Part of this uncertainty may result from the absence of a universal method of assessing this condition. We undertook a review of the literature in order to summarize the various methods by which Dupuytren's disease has been measured and quantified. We included all articles that offered a classification or assessment system for the disease. We excluded articles that dealt solely with surgical technique (although inevitably there was some overlap). We conclude that there are many methods of assessment, but that none of them is perfect and that further work is needed in the field. ","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",25618867,2015
[Treatment of Dupuytren's disease with collagenase - a 1-year follow-up of 37 patients].,"INTRODUCTION: The efficiency of collagenase of Clostridium histolyticum (CCH; Xiapex) in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture has been proved in phase III studies. This retrospective study aims to evaluate our clinical results after the use of CCH.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 40 Dupuytren's contractures in 37 patients. There were 32 male and 5 female patients; their average age was 66 years. The most affected finger was the ring finger (55%; 22/40), followed by the little finger (30%; 12/40) and the middle finger (15; 6/40). 14 fingers (35%) presented isolated contractures of the metacarpophalangeal joint whereas an isolated contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint was evident in 8 (20%) fingers. 18 (45%) fingers presented combined MCP and PIP flexion contractures. None of the patients underwent any treatment prior to this study. A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients. Follow-up examinations were performed seven days, fourteen days, three months, six months and one year after the intervention. The follow-up examination included goniometry of each affected finger to assess the range of motion (ROM) before and after cord breaking. Further patient-reported outcome was accessed concerning postinterventional complaints, impairment of sensibility and satisfaction with the treatment.RESULTS: The range of motion improved in all fingers. Full extension of the affected finger without any contracture could be observed in 93% of the MCP contractures, 38% of the PIP contractures and in 28% of the combined MCP and PIP contractures. Incomplete cord breaking could be observed in 9 (22.5%) fingers. In 8 fingers (20%) skin tears occurred after joint manipulation but healed up without any further surgical intervention. The recurrence rate at the latest follow-up was 2.5% (1/40). Patient satisfaction was high and none of the patients reported any complaints at the latest follow-up.CONCLUSION: The best results could be achieved in patients with isolated contractures of the MCP joint. Regarding the good functional results, the low complication rates and the high patient satisfaction, CCH represents a simple and effective treatment for Dupuytren's contracture in selected cases.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",25564949,2015
Construct validity of the canadian occupational performance measure in participants with tendon injury and Dupuytren disease.,"BACKGROUND: In patient-centered practice, instruments need to assess outcomes that are meaningful to patients with hand conditions. It is unclear which assessment tools address these subjective perspectives best.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish the construct validity of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) in relation to the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) in people with hand conditions. It was hypothesized that COPM scores would correlate with DASH and MHQ total scores only to a moderate degree and that the COPM, DASH questionnaire, and MHQ would all correlate weakly with measures of hand impairments.DESIGN: This was a validation study.METHODS: The COPM, DASH questionnaire, and MHQ were scored, and then hand impairments were measured (pain [numerical rating scale], active range of motion [goniometer], grip strength [dynamometer], and pinch grip strength [pinch meter]). People who had received postsurgery rehabilitation for flexor tendon injuries, extensor tendon injuries, or Dupuytren disease were eligible.RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were included. For all diagnosis groups, the Pearson coefficient of correlation between the DASH questionnaire and the MHQ was higher than .60, whereas the correlation between the performance scale of the COPM and either the DASH questionnaire or the MHQ was lower than .51. Correlations of these assessment tools with measures of hand impairments were lower than .46.LIMITATIONS: The small sample sizes may limit the generalization of the results.CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypotheses and, thus, the construct validity of the COPM after surgery in people with hand conditions.",Physical therapy,25524872,2014
Linear regression analysis of Hospital Episode Statistics predicts a large increase in demand for elective hand surgery in England.,"INTRODUCTION: We integrated two factors, demographic population shifts and changes in prevalence of disease, to predict future trends in demand for hand surgery in England, to facilitate workforce planning.METHODS: We analysed Hospital Episode Statistics data for Dupuytren's disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and trigger finger from 1998 to 2011. Using linear regression, we estimated trends in both diagnosis and surgery until 2030. We integrated this regression with age specific population data from the Office for National Statistics in order to estimate how this will contribute to a change in workload over time.RESULTS: There has been a significant increase in both absolute numbers of diagnoses and surgery for all four conditions. Combined with future population data, we calculate that the total operative burden for these four conditions will increase from 87,582 in 2011 to 170,166 (95% confidence interval 144,517-195,353) in 2030.DISCUSSION: The prevalence of these diseases in the ageing population, and increasing prevalence of predisposing factors such as obesity and diabetes, may account for the predicted increase in workload. The most cost effective treatments must be sought, which requires high quality clinical trials. Our methodology can be applied to other sub-specialties to help anticipate the need for future service provision.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",25455287,2014
Dupuytren contracture recurrence project: reaching consensus on a definition of recurrence.,"The aim of this study was to determine a definition of recurrence of Dupuytren disease that could be utilized for the comparison of the results independently from the treatment used. 24 hand surgeons from 17 countries met in an international consensus conference. The participants used the Delphi method to evaluate a series of statements: (1) the need for defining recurrence, (2) the concept of recurrence applied to the Tubiana staging system, (3) the concept of recurrence applied to each single treated joint, and (4) the concept of recurrence applied to the finger ray. For each item, the possible answer was given on a scale of 1-5: 1=maximum disagreement; 2=disagreement; 3=agreement; 4=strong agreement; 5=absolute agreement. There was consensus on disagreement if 1 and 2 comprised at least 66% of the recorded answers and consensus on agreement if 3, 4 and 5 comprised at least 66% of the recorded answers. If a threshold of 66% was not reached, the related statement was considered &quot;not defined&quot;. A need for a definition of recurrence was established. The presence of nodules or cords without finger contracture was not considered an indication of recurrence. The Tubiana staging system was considered inappropriate for reporting recurrence. Recurrence was best determined by the measurement of a specific joint, rather than a total ray. Time 0 occurred between 6 weeks and 3 months. Recurrence was defined as a PED of more than 20° for at least one of treated joint, in the presence of a palpable cord, compared to the result obtained at time 0. This study determined the need for a standard definition of recurrence and reached consensus on that definition, which we should become the standard for the reporting of recurrence. If utilized in subsequent publications, this will allow surgeons to compare different techniques and make is easier to help patients make an informed choice.

Identification of histological patterns in clinically affected and unaffected palm regions in dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a fibro-proliferative disease characterized by a disorder of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and high myofibroblast proliferation. However, studies failed to determine if the whole palm fascia is affected by the disease. The objective of this study was to analyze several components of the extracellular matrix of three types of tissues-Dupuytren's diseased contracture cords (DDC), palmar fascia clinically unaffected by Dupuytren's disease contracture (NPF), and normal forehand fascia (NFF). Histological analysis, quantification of cells recultured from each type of tissue, mRNA microarrays and immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle actin (SMA), fibrillar ECM components and non-fibrillar ECM components were carried out. The results showed that DDC samples had abundant fibrosis with reticular fibers and few elastic fibers, high cell proliferation and myofibroblasts, laminin and glycoproteins, whereas NFF did not show any of these findings. Interestingly, NPF tissues had more cells showing myofibroblasts differentiation and more collagen and reticular fibers, laminin and glycoproteins than NFF, although at lower level than DDC, with similar elastic fibers than DDC. Immunohistochemical expression of decorin was high in DDC, whereas versican was highly expressed NFF, with no differences for aggrecan. Cluster analysis revealed that the global expression profile of NPF was very similar to DDC, and reculturing methods showed that cells corresponding to DDC tissues proliferated more actively than NPF, and NPF more actively than NFF. All these results suggest that NPF tissues may be affected, and that a modification of the therapeutic approach used for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease should be considered.

"Psychometric evaluation of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) with Dupuytren's contracture: validity evidence using Rasch modeling.","BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture is a progressive, fibroproliferative disorder that causes fixed finger contractures and can lead to disability. With the advances of new therapeutic interventions, the necessity to assess the functional repercussions of this condition using valid, reliable and sensitive outcome measures is of growing interest. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) is one frequently used patient-reported outcome measure but its reliability and validity have never been demonstrated specifically for a population affected with Dupuytren's contracture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the DASH, with focus on validity evidence using the Rasch measurement model.METHODS: Secondary analysis was performed on data collected as part of a randomised clinical trial. One hundred fifty-three participants diagnosed with Dupuytren's contracture completed the DASH at four time points (pre-op, 3, 6 and 12 months post-op). Baseline data were analysed using traditional analysis and to test whether they adhered to the expectations of the Rasch model. Post-intervention data were subsequently included and analyzed to determine the effect of the intervention on the items.RESULTS: DASH scores demonstrated large ceiling effects at all time points. Initial fit to the Rasch model revealed that the DASH did not adhere to the expectations of the Rasch partial credit model (χ2=119.92; p&lt;0.05). Multiple items displayed inadequate response categories and two items displayed differential item functioning by gender. Items were transformed and one item deleted leading to an adequate fit. Remaining items fit the Rasch model but still do not target well the population under study.CONCLUSIONS: The original version of the 30-item DASH did not display adequate validity evidence for use in a population with Dupuytren's contracture. Further development is required to improve the DASH for this population.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,25358527,2014
"Minimally invasive options in Dupuytren's contracture: aponeurotomy, enzymes, stretching, and fat grafting.","LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: (1) Perform needle aponeurotomy, fat grafting, Digit Widget insertion, and collagenase injection for Dupuytren's cords. (2) Describe how cords can be stretched without surgery. (3) Explain to patients the risks and benefits of these new alternatives of treatments.SUMMARY: Surgery for Dupuytren's contracture used to be the only alternative of treatment. The past 5 years have seen the widespread adoption of minimally invasive treatments in the form of needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injection to disrupt the cords and restore range of motion. Even newer and perhaps as effective treatments such as fat grafting and mechanical stretching with the Digit Widget may also end up being important tools of treatment.

Dupuytren's contracture: emerging insight into a Viking disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative condition of the palm, with a predilection for men, which has affected Northern Europeans since the Viking conquests. Although strongly heritable, clear evidence exists for environmental factors that modify the underlying genetic risk, such as diabetes, heavy drinking, and smoking. Evidence also exists for epilepsy (probably due to treatment with certain anti-epileptic drugs), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Recent large studies have shown no relationship with manual labour or vibrating tools. Two theories have emerged regarding the pathogenic mechanism: the first attributes the aberrant healing process that characterises Dupuytren's to free radicals, generated as a result of microangiopathy, whereas the second cites a genetic tendency toward apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. Despite only one study demonstrating linkage, emerging data from genome-wide association studies highlight a series of single nucleotide polymorphisms near members of the Wnt signalling pathway, and transcriptional profiling studies have consistently identified certain components of the extracellular matrix.

"Radiotherapy with soft X-rays in Dupuytren's disease - successful, well-tolerated and satisfying.","BACKGROUND: Up to present no curative treatment is known for Dupuytren's disease (DD). Surgery remains the most common treatment but lack of long-term efficacy and complications limit this therapeutic option.OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective analysis, the results of radiotherapy with soft X-rays in the treatment of DD were evaluated.METHODS: A total of 206 patients (297 affected hands) with DD were included. Radiation therapy was carried out with soft X-rays. A structured questionnaire considering patient and disease characteristics and effects of radiotherapy was evaluated after a median follow-up time of 40 months.RESULTS: Ninety-three (45%) of the 206 treated patients were reported on a regression of symptoms after radiation. No further disease progression (including patients with regression) was present in 165 patients (80%). Satisfaction with the therapy was expressed with an average score of 7.9 points (visual analogue scale, 0 = not satisfied, 10 = extremely satisfied).

The prevalence of Dupuytren contractures in patients with psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren contracture (DC) is a fibrocontractile disease of the palms, affecting approximately 4% of the population, while psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease, affecting 2% of the population. Through clinical observation in our psoriasis clinic, we found an apparent increased prevalence of DC in patients with psoriasis compared with the general population. This has not previously been statistically verified in a clinical study.AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of DC in the full range of clinical psoriasis phenotypes.METHODS: In total, 98 patients with psoriasis attending our psoriasis clinic were examined for DC, based on predetermined criteria. In addition, 84 patients with DC, obtained from a specialist hand clinic, were assessed using a validated psoriasis questionnaire. We utilized Bayes theorem and bootstrap simulation to calculate the conditional prevalence of DC, then we used the results to compare the prevalence of DC between patients with psoriasis and a nonpsoriasis population.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with DC was 19.6% in the psoriasis population and 3.6% in the nonpsoriasis population. Development of DC showed a phenotypic predilection, with 39.1% of patients with predominantly palmoplantar involvement and 38.9% of patients with intertriginous psoriasis developing DC compared with 12.7% of patients with psoriasis who did not have these two phenotypical presentations.CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a positive correlation between psoriasis and DC. Patients with the palmoplantar phenotype of psoriasis were more likely to develop DC. By understanding this relationship, dermatologists may diagnose DC early in its onset in patients with psoriasis, prompting referral to hand surgeons when appropriate.",Clinical and experimental dermatology,25196833,2014
Prospective randomized controlled trial comparing 1- versus 7-day manipulation following collagenase injection for dupuytren contracture.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of manual manipulation at day 7 to day 1 following collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection for Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to manipulation at day 1 versus day 7 following CCH injection. Preinjection, premanipulation, postmanipulation, and 30-day follow-up metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures were measured. Pain scores were recorded at each time point. Data were stratified per cohort based on primary joint treated (MCP vs PIP). Means were compared using paired and unpaired t-tests.RESULTS: Forty-three patients with 46 digits were eligible and were randomized to 1-day (22 digits) and 7-day (24 digits) manipulation. For MCP joints, there were no significant differences in flexion contractures between 1- and 7-day cohorts for initial (47° vs 46°), postmanipulation (0° vs 2°), or 30-day follow-up (1° vs 2°) measurements. Premanipulation, the residual contracture was significantly lower in the 7-day group (23° vs 40°). For PIP joints, there were no significant differences between 1- and 7-day cohorts for initial (63° vs 62°), premanipulation (56° vs 52°), postmanipulation (13° vs 15°), or 30-day (14° vs 16°) measurements. There were no significant differences in pain or skin tears between the 2 groups. No flexor tendon ruptures were observed.CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of CCH in achieving correction of Dupuytren contractures was preserved when manipulation was performed on day 7, with no differences in correction, pain, or skin tears. These data suggest that manipulation can be scheduled at the convenience of the patient and surgeon within the first 7 days after injection.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.",The Journal of hand surgery,25194768,2014
"Hospitalization for Dupuytren's disease: a French national descriptive analysis, 2002 to 2009.","OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to describe hospitalization for treatment of Dupuytren's disease in France between 2002 and 2009.METHODS: A repeated, annual, cross-sectional national survey of public and private French hospitals was performed between 2002 and 2009, with planned selection criteria for data extraction. Outcomes were age, sex, number of hospitalizations, length of stays, and types of surgical procedure. Types of surgical procedure included aponeurectomy, aponeurotomy, transplantation (skin graft), arthrolysis, amputation, arthrodesis, combined procedures.RESULTS: The selected hospital stays represented 95% to 97% of all stays with Dupuytren's disease coded as the primary diagnosis. The hospitalizations involved mainly men in the 7th decade. The mean number of hospitalizations for Dupuytren's disease was 16,487, for between 7 and 8/10,000 total hospitalizations each year. Most of the hospitalizations for Dupuytren's disease were one-day stays in private settings. Over time, the mean length of hospital stay significantly shortened and the proportion of one-day stays significantly increased. Aponeurectomy was the most reported treatment. The distribution of aponeurectomy of 1 finger or ≥ 2 fingers was balanced. The performance of arthrolysis, transplantation, amputation and arthrodesis was low.CONCLUSIONS: Despite of shortening of hospitals stays over time, hospitalization for surgery for Dupuytren's disease in France still represents a meaningful economic burden.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Observational study II.","Orthopaedics &amp; traumatology, surgery &amp; research : OTSR",25164352,2014
What is the better treatment for single digit dupuytren's contracture: surgical release or collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiapex) injection?,"The purpose of this study was to compare the initial and final outcome range of motion in the MCP-J and PIP-J of single digit Dupuytren's Contracture treated with either open surgical excision or manipulation after collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH; Xiapex) injection.</AbstractText>: The purpose of this study was to compare the initial and final outcome range of motion in the MCP-J and PIP-J of single digit Dupuytren's Contracture treated with either open surgical excision or manipulation after collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH; Xiapex) injection.MATERIAL: Ten patients in either group. The range of motion measurements were statistically compared using the student t-test with a p-value of 0.05. There was no statistical difference in the pre-treatment status of the total active range of movement (TAM) between the two groups.RESULTS: Open surgical release achieved a statistically better initial outcome in combined total passive range of movement than the xiapex group (p = 0.0047), but at the final outcome the better TAM measurement at the MCP-J after surgery was not statistically significant. However, the total active range of movement was statistically better at the PIP-J level in the xiapex group (p = 0.01) and the MCP-J and PIP-J combined total active range of movement was statistically better in the xiapex group (p = 0.0258).CONCLUSION: Surgery achieved better initial outcome at both MCP-J and PIP-J levels, and at discharge, only extension in the MCP-J level was statistically better after open excision. However the final outcome was statistically better at the PIP-J level in extension (p = 0.006) and total active movement (TAM) (p = 0.008) after treatment with collagenase clostridium histolyticum.

Steroid injection and needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren disease: long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: To compare long-term outcomes and retreatment rates for patients with Dupuytren disease who underwent needle aponeurotomy (NA) combined with a series of triamcinolone acetonide injections or underwent NA alone as part of a prior randomized controlled trial.METHODS: During this follow-up study, 44 of 47 participants in the original study were examined as needed between 6 and 53 months from their initial procedure. Those who had not been reassessed within 18 months of the original NA were asked to return for follow-up. The average total active extension deficit (TAED) of previously treated joints was compared between groups 7 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, and 37 to 48 months following treatment. Timing of retreatment (if performed) was recorded.RESULTS: Forty-four participants returned for assessment an average of 4.8 times over 53 months. Mean TAED was significantly less in needle aponeurotomy triamcinolone injection patients at 6 months and between 13 and 24 months. Sixty-two percent of NA group patients and 30% of needle aponeurotomy triamcinolone injection patients returned for a second treatment on the same digit(s) (retreatment). This difference was not significant. Mean time to retreatment and mean TAED immediately prior to retreatment did not differ significantly between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of NA group patients expected to return for retreatment by 24 but not by 36 months. Younger age, more than one joint treated at the initial NA, and TAED severity throughout the follow-up period were associated with earlier retreatment.CONCLUSIONS: Serial triamcinolone injections combined with NA was associated with lower TAED for up to 24 months. A larger study would more accurately quantify the potential benefits of combining triamcinolone injections with NA for treatment of Dupuytren disease.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,25149899,2014
IGF2 expression and β-catenin levels are increased in Frozen Shoulder Syndrome.,"PURPOSE: Frozen Shoulder Syndrome is a fibrosis of the shoulder joint capsule that is clinically associated with Dupuytren's disease, a fibrosis of the palmar fascia. Little is known about any commonalities in the pathophysiology of these connective tissue fibroses. β-catenin, a protein that transactivates gene expression, and levels of IGF2 mRNA, encoding insulin-like growth factor-II, are elevated in Dupuytren's disease. The aim of this study was to determine if correlating changes in β-catenin levels and IGF2 expression are evident in Frozen Shoulder Syndrome.METHODS: Tissue from patients with Frozen Shoulder Syndrome and rotator cuff tear were obtained during shoulder arthroscopies. Total protein extracts were prepared from tissue aliquots and β-catenin immunoreactivity was assessed by Western immunoblotting. In parallel, primary fibroblasts were derived from these tissues and assessed for IGF2 expression by quantitative PCR.RESULTS: β-catenin levels were significantly increased in Frozen Shoulder Syndrome relative to rotator cuff tear when assessed by Western immunoblotting analyses. IGF2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in primary fibroblasts derived from frozen shoulder syndrome tissues relative to fibroblasts derived from rotator cuff tissues.CONCLUSIONS: As in Dupuytren's disease, β-catenin levels and IGF2 expression are elevated in Frozen Shoulder Syndrome.

Multiple collagenase injections are safe for treatment of Dupuytren's contractures.,"The authors report the case of a 65-year-old, right-hand-dominant man who had severe Dupuytren's disease with multiple cords and flexion contractures of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands and underwent repeated collagenase injections for treatment. Collagenase has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of Dupuytren's contractures when administered as a single dose, but the results of multiple injections over a prolonged period are unknown. Antibodies to collagenase develop in all patients after several treatments, raising concerns about safety and efficacy as a result of sensitization from repeated exposures. The antibodies generated as a result of repeated exposure to collagenase could theoretically render it less effective with time and could also lead to immune reactions as severe as anaphylaxis. The authors present the case of a single patient who experienced continued correction of his contractures with only minor and self-limited adverse reactions after administration of 12 collagenase doses through 15 injections during a 4-year period. Over time, the injections continued to be effective at correcting metacarpophalangeal joint contractures, but less effective at correcting proximal interphalangeal joint contractures. The patient did eventually require a fasciectomy, but the safety and modest success of the repeated collagenase injections shows promise for a less invasive treatment with a better risk profile than open fasciectomy. Although further studies are needed, repeated administration of collagenase appears to be safe and modestly effective for severe Dupuytren's contractures, although a fasciectomy may ultimately be required in the most severe cases.

[Collagenase-A revolution of Dupuytren's therapy].,"Up to date, Dupuytren's contracture is a disease without cure. Almost 20 years ago, enzymatic cord degradation with clostridial collagenase was described for the first time. Whereas until recently limited fasciectomy was the treatment of choice for most of the patients, now collagenase offers a minimally invasive treatment in cases with palpable cords. Collagenase is a safe and effective treatment with success rates around 85 % for MCP joint and 65 % for PIP joints and a low complication rate. One point of concern is the recurrence rate which is higher compared to open surgery. A review of the literature is presented, technique and indication for collagenase are discussed.

The chick chorioallantoic membrane: a model of short-term study of Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder that impairs hand function by altering the normal structures of the palmar fascial bands. Nodules composed almost entirely of myofibroblasts and cords are pathognomonic of Dupuytren's disease. The myofibroblasts express alpha-smooth muscle actin that is especially involved in development of the disease. We aimed to evaluate whether the xenograft of Dupuytren's fibromatosis taken from operating room and transplanted on chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) survives with its histological and immunohistological features. Fresh samples obtained from eight patients with Dupuytren's disease were minced and immediately inoculated onto 24 CAMs of 8-day-old chick embryos. The implanted CAMs were examined daily by stereomicroscopy and finally the xenografts were examined and characterized in histological sections using a panel of antibodies. The xenografts were incorporated into the CAMs 6-7 days after transplantation, continued to grow and stimulated angiogenesis in the chick embryo CAMs. The CAMs vessels entered the xenografts and anastomosed with the newly formed xenografts vessels (CD34+ and CD105+) those containing nucleated chick erythrocytes. Myofibroblasts (α-SMA+) and macrophages (CD68+) were readily recognized in the xenograft thickness. We concluded that the xenografts of Dupuytren's fibromatosis transplanted onto chick embryo CAMs continued to develop and preserved the histological and immunohistological features.

Hand function and quality of life before and after fasciectomy for Dupuytren contracture.,"PURPOSE: To describe changes in joint motion, sensibility, and scar pliability and to investigate the patients' expectations, self-reported recovery, and satisfaction with hand function, disability, and quality of life after surgery and hand therapy for Dupuytren disease.METHODS: This prospective cohort study collected measurements before surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and hand therapy. Ninety patients with total active extension deficits of 60° or more from Dupuytren contracture were included. Outcomes measures were range of motion; sensibility; scar pliability; self-reported outcomes on expectations, recovery, and satisfaction with hand function; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores; safety and social issues of hand function; physical activity habits; and quality of life with the Euroqol.RESULTS: The extension deficit decreased, and there was a transient decrease in active finger flexion during the first year after surgery. Sensibility remained unaffected. Generally, patients with surgery on multiple fingers had worse scar pliability. The majority of the patients had their expectations met, and at 6 months, 32% considered hand function as fully recovered, and 73% were satisfied with their hand function. Fear of hurting the hand and worry about not trusting the hand function were of greatest concern among safety and social issues. The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score and the Euroqol improved over time.CONCLUSIONS: After surgery and hand therapy, disability decreased independent of single or multiple operated fingers. The total active finger extension improved enough for the patients to reach a functional range of motion despite an impairment of active finger flexion still present 12 months after treatment.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,24969497,2014
First identification of resident and circulating fibrocytes in Dupuytren's disease shown to be inhibited by serum amyloid P and Xiapex.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common progressive fibroproliferative disorder causing permanent digital contracture. Proliferative myofibroblasts are thought to be the cells responsible for DD initiation and recurrence, although their source remains unknown. DD tissue has also been shown to harbor mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells. Fibrocytes are circulating cells that show characteristics of fibroblasts and they express surface markers for both hematopoietic and mesenchymal stromal cells. Fibrocytes differentiate from peripheral CD14+ mononuclear cells, which can be inhibited by serum amyloid P (SAP). In this study we have demonstrated the presence of fibrocytes in DD blood and tissue, moreover we have evaluated the effects of SAP and Xiapex (Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum) on fibrocytes derived from DD. H&amp;E staining showed typical Spindle shaped morphology of fibrocytes. FACS analysis based on a unique combination of 3 markers, revealed the increased presence of fibrocytes in blood and tissue of DD patients. Additionally, immunohistology of DD nodule and cord tissue showed the presence of collagen 1+/CD34+ cells. No difference in plasma SAP levels was observed between DD and control. Higher concentrations of SAP significantly inhibited fibrocytes differentiated from DD derived monocytes compared to control. DD fascia derived fibrocytes showed resistance to growth inhibition by SAP, particularly nodule derived fibrocytes showed robust growth even at higher SAP concentrations compared to control. DD derived fibrocytes were positive for typical fibrocyte dual markers, i.e. Collagen 1/LSP-1 and collagen 1/CD34. Xiapex was more effective in inhibiting the growth of nodule derived cells compared to commercially available collagenase A. Our results show for the first time the increased presence of fibrocytes in DD patient's blood and disease tissue compared to control tissue. Additionally, we evaluate the response of these fibrocytes to SAP and Xiapex therapy. ",PloS one,24933153,2014

HLA class I and class II typing was performed using the polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer method.RESULTS: The HLAB*18 phenotype was observed in 32% of the patients and 10.5% of controls. However, P values did not remain significant after correction.DISCUSSION: Although we observed an increased tendency of DC patients to possess the HLA-B*18 allele, the results were not statistically significant after correction. This allele was higher in patients of Italian and/or Spanish ethnicity, localities with frequencies higher than 18.0% and 14.0% respectively.

Technical tips for collagenase injection treatment for Dupuytren contracture.,"We describe technical tips for injecting collagenase into Dupuytren cords based on experience acquired during the prerelease Food and Drug Administration clinical trials and with subsequent clinical practice. These tips include techniques for extracting the reconstituted enzyme efficiently from the vial, injecting the cord(s) with increased safety to the tendons, and anesthetizing the hand before manipulation. The tips are intended to supplement but by no means replace the manufacturer's prescribing information and training video. ",The Journal of hand surgery,24862115,2014
"Genetic and environmental influences in Dupuytren's disease: a study of 30,330 Danish twin pairs.","We aimed to assess the relative contribution of genes and environment in the aetiology of Dupuytren's disease by studying Danish twins born between 1870 and 2000. Twins with a diagnosis (n = 365) and the subgroup who also had an operation (n = 259) after 1977 were identified through linkage with a nationwide hospital registry among 30,330 monozygotic and same-sexed dizygotic twin pairs. Since monozygotic twins share all their genes and dizygotic twins share on average half of their genetic material, greater phenotypic similarity is expected in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins if a genetic component is involved. The number of concordant male twin pairs with Dupuytren's disease was 17 and 7 (monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, respectively), compared with 60 and 174 discordant monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, yielding probandwise concordance rates of 0.37 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26 to 0.50) and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.14), respectively. The heritability of Dupuytren's disease was approximately 80%. We conclude that genetic factors play a major role in the development of Dupuytren's disease.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",24835475,2014
Patterns of Dupuytren disease in fingers: studying correlations with a multivariate ordinal logit model.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren disease affects fingers in a variable fashion. Knowledge about specific disease patterns (phenotype) based on location and severity of the disease is lacking.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 344 primary affected hands with Dupuytren disease were physically examined. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the coexistence of Dupuytren disease in pairs of fingers was calculated, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering was applied to identify possible clusters of affected fingers. With a multivariate ordinal logit model, the authors studied the correlation on severity, taking into account age and sex, and tested hypotheses on independence between groups of fingers.RESULTS: The ring finger was most frequently affected by Dupuytren disease, and contractures were seen in 15.1 percent of affected rays. The severity of thumb and index finger, middle and ring fingers, and middle and little fingers was significantly correlated. Occurrences in pairs of fingers were highest in the middle and ring fingers and lowest in the thumb and index finger. Correlation between the ring and little fingers and a correlation between fingers from the ulnar and radial sides could not be demonstrated.CONCLUSIONS: Rays on the ulnar side of the hand are predominantly affected. The middle finger is substantially correlated with other fingers on the ulnar side, and the thumb and index finger are correlated; however, there was no evidence that the ulnar side and the radial side were correlated in any way, which suggests that occurrence on one side of the hand does not predict Dupuytren disease on the other side of the hand.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, III.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,24804640,2014
Presence of multiple tendinous insertions of palmaris longus: a unique variation of a retrogressive muscle.,"BACKGROUND: Palmaris longus, being the most variable muscle of the upper extremity is generally considered important morphologically rather than functionally. The palmar aponeurosis represents the distal part of the tendon of Palmaris longus.CASE DETAILS: We report here a unique case of palmaris longus presenting variation distally as its tendon divides to gain multiple attachments with the fascia covering the abductor pollicis brevis, flexor retinaculum and the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris. In addition, it also continues as palmar aponeurosis as its normal course.CONCLUSION: Presence of this kind of variation might result in compression of the median and ulnar nerves and may aggravate the complications in case of inflammation of palmar aponeurosis thus mimicking the manifestations of Dupuytren's contracture.",Ethiopian journal of health sciences,24795520,2014
Evidence-based medicine: Dupuytren contracture.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: (1) Describe features and clinical importance of Dupuytren diathesis. (2) Explain the difference between the new definition of recurrence used in collagenase studies compared with prior definitions of recurrence. (3) Compare and list the main advantage/main disadvantage of fasciectomy versus minimally invasive treatment (collagenase injection or needle aponeurotomy) of Dupuytren contracture.SUMMARY: The large body of existing literature on Dupuytren disease is spread across many journals in many specialties. It is thus a daunting task for practitioners to follow trends and practice recommendations. It is also a testimony to the lack of an acceptable solution to this common problem. Recent publications provide evidence to highlight controversies and challenge some traditional teachings. Literature from 2010 to 2012 was reviewed with the intent of clarifying some of these issues.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,24776555,2014
The importance of genetic susceptibility in Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a progressive fibromatosis that causes the formation of nodules and cords in the palmar aponeurosis leading to flexion contracture of affected fingers. The etiopathogenesis is multifactorial with a strong genetic predisposition. It is the most frequent genetic disorder of connective tissues. We have collected clinical data from 736 unrelated individuals with DD who underwent surgical treatment from Germany and Switzerland. We evaluated a standardised questionnaire, assessed the importance of different risk factors and compared subgroups with and without positive family history. We found that family history clearly had the strongest influence on the age at first surgery compared to environmental factors, followed by male sex. Participants with a positive family history were on average 55.9 years of age at the first surgical intervention, 5.2 years younger than probands without known family history (p = 6.7 × 10(-8) ). The percentage of familial cases decreased with age of onset from 55% in the 40-49 years old to 17% at age 80 years or older. Further risk factors analysed were cigarettes, alcohol, diabetes, hypertension, and epilepsy. Our data pinpoint the importance of genetic susceptibility for DD, which has long been underestimated.

High-dosage tamoxifen as neoadjuvant treatment in minimally invasive surgery for Dupuytren disease in patients with a strong predisposition toward fibrosis: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen, a synthetic nonsteroidal anti-estrogen known to modulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), has demonstrated effectiveness on fibroblast activity in vitro and in vivo. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of tamoxifen on the outcome of surgery for Dupuytren contractures in patients with a strong predisposition toward fibrosis.METHODS: We used a prospective, randomized, double-blind study protocol (conforming to the CONSORT standards) to investigate the influence of tamoxifen compared with placebo on the total passive extension deficit in the finger and patient satisfaction after subtotal fasciectomy in thirty patients with a strong predisposition toward fibrosis (grade, &gt;4 according to the Abe scale). High-dosage tamoxifen (80 mg/day) was administered from six weeks prior until twelve weeks after surgery, and patients were monitored for two years.RESULTS: Three months after surgery, patients in the tamoxifen group had a smaller total passive extension deficit and higher satisfaction compared with the placebo group. This positive effect was lost over the two years following cessation of the medication.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the short-term outcome of Dupuytren disease treatment could be influenced by use of tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant from six weeks prior to three months after subtotal fasciectomy in patients with a strong predisposition toward fibrosis. However, the beneficial effect disappeared within two years after surgery, with worsening of the contractures after the medication was discontinued. Thus, tamoxifen may have a short-term effect on the outcome of surgery for Dupuytren disease.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,24740662,2014
Acute double flexor tendon ruptures following injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiapex) for Dupuytren's contracture.,"We report a case of acute (24 h) double flexor tendon rupture of the little finger after a single injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum into a palmar Dupuytren's contracture cord which caused metacarpophalangeal joint contracture. Tendon surgery was performed 48 h postinjury with primary repair and standard rehabilitation but it resulted in poor active flexion due to adhesions. Previous papers have suggested that a needle inserted into the flexor tendon can be detected prior to the injection of collagenase by asking the patient to actively move the finger, but our test on an awake patient showed that when a 27-gauge needle was inserted into the flexor tendons through a thick palmar cord, the syringe did not move significantly when the patient moved the finger, and therefore this test does not minimise the risk of iatrogenic tendon injury when using collagenase (Xiapex) for Dupuytren's contracture.

Contemporary management of dupuytren contracture.,"Dupuytren contracture is a condition that affects the palmar fascia. It most commonly affects men of northern European ancestry and initially presents at middle age. The diseased fascia may form cords that extend into the digits, resulting in limited motion and function. Treatment is aimed at either releasing or removing the diseased cord so that the finger can extend fully. Common interventions include surgery, needle aponeurotomy, and collagenase injection. Surgery remains the gold standard in treatment and most commonly includes a limited fasciectomy. Although often successful, surgery carries inherent risks and may involve a lengthy recovery with extensive therapy. Needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injections are office-based alternatives that aim to weaken the cord and release the contracture. Needle aponeurotomy involves repeated needling along the cord in intervals and collagenase injections to dissolve a portion of the cord. Despite being less invasive, problems such as nerve and/or tendon injury, skin tears, and autoimmune reactions have been reported. Regardless of treatment, recurrence remains a concern.

Early results of the use of collagenase in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the enzyme collagenase has been developed for the percutaneous treatment of Dupuytren's contracture, allowing management of the condition as an outpatient. We present early results on the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture using injectable collagenase.METHODS: Patients awaiting Fasciectomy for Dupuytren's Contracture were selected for enrolment. Contracture cords were then marked and injected with collagenase in the outpatients department. Twenty-four hours later, patients returned for an extension procedure, performed under regional anaesthesia. Hand therapy was then commenced as for surgical release. Contracture angles were measured pre-injection and at follow-up.RESULTS: Thirteen fingers were treated in 10 patients with a mean age of 66 years. Eight little fingers and five ring fingers were treated. Four fingers had isolated metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) contracture, one finger had isolated proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) contracture and the remainder had combined contractures. Mean pre-treatment MCPJ contracture was 58.6° and the mean pre-treatment PIPJ contracture was 39°. Post-treatment contracture was 4.23° and 9° for the MCPJ and PIPJ, respectively. All patients were satisfied with their results.COMPLICATIONS: Significant post-injection bruising occured in one patient. Skin tears occurred in 11 digits, and in all cases healed without intervention. No tendon rupture occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase is a safe and effective outpatient-based treatment for Dupuytren's contracture, which may be useful in controlling surgical waiting lists. We recommend its use as first-line treatment in patients who are unsuitable more invasive treatment alternatives.",Irish journal of medical science,24705775,2014
"Early outcomes of a sequential series of 144 patients with Dupuytren's contracture treated by collagenase injection using an increased dose, multi-cord technique.","Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is the first and only United States Food and Drug Association approved nonsurgical treatment for patients with a palpable Dupuytren's contracture cord. However, the Food and Drug Association has only approved injection of 0.58 mg of this enzyme into one palpable Dupuytren's contracture cord at a time. This review reports on the early outcome of 144 patients treated with the entire bottle of enzyme, approximately 0.78 mg, along with use of a novel slow intracord multi-cord technique. Use of 0.78 mg of enzyme, with the slow intracord multi-cord technique is safe and allows one to inject multiple Dupuytren's contracture cords at one setting. Correction at metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, taken individually, are comparable with the Collagenase Option for the Reduction of Dupuytren's studies at 43° and 33°, respectively, however due to the multi-cord injection, we achieved 94° average immediate and 76° average final combined metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal contracture releases per bottle of enzyme. Implementation of the slow intracord multi-cord technique has the potential to improve current treatment for Dupuytren's contracture with resultant significant healthcare savings.

Safety and tolerability of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum and fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Safety was evaluated for collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) based on 11 clinical trials (N = 1082) and compared with fasciectomy data in a structured literature review of 48 European studies (N = 7727) for treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Incidence of adverse events was numerically lower with CCH vs. equivalent complications from fasciectomy (median [range] incidence), including nerve injury (0% vs. 3.8% [0%-50+%]), neurapraxia (4.4% vs. 9.4% [0%-51.3%]), complex regional pain syndrome (0.1% vs. 4.5% [1.3%-18.5%]) and arterial injury (0% vs. 5.5% [0.8%-16.5%]). Tendon injury (0.3% vs. 0.1% [0%-0.2%]), skin injury (16.2% vs. 2.8% [0%-25.9%]) and haematoma (77.7% vs. 2.0% [0%-25%]) occurred at a numerically higher incidence with CCH than surgery. Adverse events in CCH trials not reported after fasciectomy included peripheral oedema; extremity pain; injection site pain, haemorrhage and swelling; tenderness; pruritus and lymphadenopathy. CCH-related adverse events were reported as predominantly injection-related and transient. These results may support clinical decision-making for treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.

Surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease - outcome and health economy in relation to smoking and diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: The conventional treatment for Dupuytren's disease is surgery. The introduction of alternative treatment strategies creates a need to track outcomes and costs relating to surgical treatment and risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes. This was the aim of the present study.METHODS: In a prospective study, the outcome of open surgical treatment for finger flexion contracture in Dupuytren's disease (175 patients; 182 surgical procedures) was studied by evaluating valid QuickDASH forms answered by subjects before surgery and one year postoperatively. Data were also obtained from medical records, and preoperative declarations concerning health.RESULTS: In all subjects (median [25% - 75% percentiles] age 68 [62-73]), the QuickDASH score improved from 22 [9-36] to 5 [0-18]. Smokers (27/179 procedures) were younger and had a more severe degree of disease and dysfunction preoperatively than non-smokers, but the outcome of surgery did not differ between the groups. Subjects with diabetes (20/181 procedures) were younger than those without diabetes, but their disease severity or outcome did not differ. Hand specialists operated faster than residents, but the surgical outcome did not differ. Healthcare costs for surgery for Dupuytren's contracture were $ 2392 (€ 1859), which were not higher among smokers or subjects with diabetes. Only 22 patients remained in hospital (2 [1-2.3] days) and 28 patients needed sick leave (28 [21-31] days). The occurrence of necrosis of skin flaps (12%) or infections (6%) was no more frequent among smokers or those with diabetes.CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in surgical outcome for finger flexion contracture in Dupuytren's disease between smokers and non-smokers or between subjects with or without diabetes, although smokers had more severe preoperative contracture. The costs for surgical treatment for finger flexion contracture in Dupuytren's disease should be viewed in relation to that for other treatment strategies.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,24694095,2014
Hueston revisited: use of acellular dermal matrix following fasciectomy for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Various surgical treatment modalities have been advocated for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. However, recurrence following surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease remains a common problem. Previous studies have demonstrated lower recurrence rates with use of a full-thickness skin graft. We therefore postulated that use of acellular dermal matrix may be associated with a similar outcome, based on the common inhibitory effect on underlying myofibroblasts. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 43 patients undergoing open fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease from years 2005 to 2012 at our academic institution. Standard fasciectomies of the affected palmar and digital fascia were performed via Brunner incisions on all patients. Patients in the experimental group had a sheet of acellular dermal matrix (Alloderm; LifeCell, Bridgewater, NJ) sutured into the surgical bed with interrupted absorbable sutures before closure, whereas patients in the control group were not closed with acellular dermal matrix. Patients were then evaluated at follow-up for disease recurrence, defined as presence of Dupuytren's tissue in an area previously operated on with a contracture greater than that recorded following the surgical fasciectomy, or presence of contracture requiring surgery. Among our cohort of 43 patients, 23 (53.5%) were treated with acellular dermal matrix while 20 (46.5%) were not. The median age of our cohort was 66.5 years (range 54-91 years). The median follow-up was 1.8 years. During this follow-up period, recurrence of contracture was observed in 1 of 23 patients in the group receiving acellular dermal matrix, compared to 5 of 20 in the control group (P = 0.045). No differences in the incidence of minor wound complications were observed. Our novel technique of placement of acellular dermal matrix into the wound bed following fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease may be an important surgical strategy to reduce recurrence rates in patients with Dupuytren's disease.

"[Collagenase injection in Dupuytren's disease, evaluation of the ultrasound assisted technique].","Since October 2011, the enzymatic lysis of Dupuytren's cord was introduced in Switzerland (Xiapex(®), Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer). Here we present our first university experience and underline the major role of ultrasound during the injection. Between December 2011 and February 2013, 52 injections were performed to eliminate 43 Dupuytren's cords in 33 patients. The mean age of the patients was 64.4 ± 8.5 years. Complications were documented for each patient. Before, directly after and after a minimum of 6 months post-injection, the contracture of the treated joint was measured with use of a goniometer. The DASH score was evaluated after a minimum of 6 months and the patients were asked to subjectively evaluate the outcome of the treatment (very good, good, mild, poor) and whether they would reiterate it if necessary. Four skin defects, one lymphangitis, and one CRPS were responsible for a complication rate of 18%. There was no infection and no tendon rupture in the series. The mean MCP joint contracture was respectively 36.8 ± 27.4°, 3.5 ± 7.8° (gain of mobility compared to the preoperative situation 33.3°, P&lt;0.001), and 8.4 ± 13.9° (gain 28.4°, P&lt;0.001) respectively before, just after and at the long-term clinical control. The mean PIP joint contracture was respectively 36.5 ± 29.1°, 5.9 ± 6.7° (gain 30.6°, P&lt;0.001), and 15.1 ± 13.8° (gain 21.4°, P&lt;0.001) respectively before injection, just after and at the long-term clinical control. The DASH score decreased from 24 ± 14 to 7 ± 9 (P&lt;0.001). Eighty-one per cent of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied of the treatment. All but two would reiterate the treatment if necessary. Ultrasound is able to target the injection of collagenase in order to reduce complications. The short-term results of this non-invasive therapy are very promising however comparison with conventional procedures is difficult as the long-term results are lacking.",Chirurgie de la main,24674697,2014
Dynamism in Dupuytren's contractures.,Dynamism of Dupuytren's contractures may occur if a contracture crosses over both the metacarpophalangeal (MCPJ) and proximal interphalangeal (PIPJ) joints of one finger. In this situation the extension deficit at one joint can be influenced by the position of the other. This may affect clinical measurements and introduce errors and bias into research using angular deformity as an endpoint. This study reports the dynamism encountered when measuring passive joint extension deficits in pre-operative contractures. Eighty-five digits with a contracture affecting the PIPJ or MCPJ and PIPJ on 72 hands from 70 patients were studied. Seventy-six digits showed dynamism at either the MCPJ or PIPJ (89%). Seventy-four showed dynamism at the PIPJ (87%). The mean dynamism observed was 6° at the MCPJ and 14° at the PIPJ. Previous Dupuytren's surgery to the finger did not influence the amount of dynamism seen. Dynamism is common and may be a source of error or bias in trials of Dupuytren's disease treatment.,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",24664160,2014
The McCash technique for Dupuytren's disease: our experience.,"This study presents the clinical outcomes of 35 hands with Dupuytren's Disease treated with the McCash technique between 1990 and 2009.

SNPs previously associated with Dupuytren's disease replicated in a North American cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Dupuytren's disease is a progressive fibrosis of the hand that often results in debilitating flexion contractures. Its etiology is not completely understood but likely involves both genetic and environmental factors. A recent study performed in Europe identified DNA variants that associate with Dupuytren's disease. Given the likelihood for genetic variation among populations, we planned to validate the genetic variants identified by this study in a North American population.METHODS: In the Marshfield Clinic's Personalized Medicine Research Project, 296 cases with Dupuytren's disease were identified and matched 3-to-1 to controls without Dupuytren's disease. Clinical data were abstracted from the electronic medical record. The top 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the European study were selected and tested in a multiplex assay using the MassArray Analyzer 4 (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences in allele frequency were determined, and variants with a P value of &lt;0.004 were considered significant.RESULTS: We replicated 5 of the 12 SNPs previously reported to be associated with Dupuytren's disease.CONCLUSION: Our findings support a role for the Wnt signaling pathway in the development of Dupuytren's disease, and suggest that further study of this pathway may result in early diagnosis and non-surgical treatments for Dupuytren's disease.",Clinical medicine &amp; research,24573701,2014
Health-related quality of life in patients undergoing palmar fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to assess the health-related quality of life in patients with Dupuytren's disease who undergo palmar fasciectomy.METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients with Dupuytren's disease undergoing palmar and/or digital fasciectomy was recruited from the practice of three plastic surgeons in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. After written informed consent was obtained, participants were asked to complete three health-related quality-of-life questionnaires (i.e., Short Form-36, Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire, and Health Utility Index Mark 3) at five time points: at 1 week and 1 day preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Ranges of motion and grip strength measurement were also recorded.RESULTS: For the 26 patients in the study, the multiattribute scores of the Health Utility Index Mark 3 improved from 0.80 before surgery to 0.83 at 12 months postoperatively (p &gt; 0.05). There was no difference in the Short Form-36 scores, but the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire scores improved from 74 at 1 week preoperatively to 90 at the 12-month postoperative visit (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo palmar fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease experience a substantial improvement in their health-related quality of life 12 months after surgery. In the authors' study population, a benefit of 0.85 quality-adjusted life-year within 12 months was observed.

URAM scale for functional assessment in Dupuytren's disease: a comparative study of its properties.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the convergent validity and ease of use of the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scale for patients with Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: Patients were prospectively included. We compared the convergent validity of the URAM scale, the Cochin Hand Function Scale (CHFS) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, in terms of their correlation with the Tubiana score and self-assessed disability on a visual analog scale (VAS). Pearson's correlation was used for the convergent validity study. The response time for questionnaire completion was the outcome for ease of implementation.RESULTS: We included 53 patients with Dupuytren's disease in the convergent validity study and 30 other patients with the disease in the time-response assessment. The URAM scale showed strong convergence with the Tubiana scale (r=0.64) and self-assessed disability on a VAS (r=0.69). Convergence with the Tubiana and self-assessed disability was higher for the URAM scale than the CHFS or DASH questionnaire. The mean [SD] response time was shorter for the URAM scale than the CHFS or DASH questionnaire (42 [20] vs 71 [35] and 103 [59] s, respectively, P&lt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The results reinforce the psychometric merits of the URAM scale. Furthermore, the response time for assessing disability was shorter with the URAM scale than the CHFS or DASH questionnaire. This evidence supports the high recommendation for the use of the URAM scale in clinical practice and clinical studies to assess disability in Dupuytren's disease.","Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",24565887,2014
What patients want from the treatment of Dupuytren's disease--is the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scale relevant?,"Patients awaiting surgery for Dupuytren's contractures listed the problems from their Dupuytren's disease that had led them to request surgery and their relative priorities of the results of surgery.

The URAM tool may not be relevant to patients in the UK, and further assessment of its face validity is required before it is used.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",24563499,2014
[Fused little finger in the palm after operation for recurrent Dupuytren's contracture].,"A 72-year-old woman suffered from Dupuytren's contracture of her right little finger, which was treated operatively 3 times in 4 years. However, the finger bent back into the palm. Over time she hid her little finger in the fist. In 2010, she presented with the hand in our office. Surprisingly a fused finger in the palm was observed. The woman reported that she had ignored her little finger and that it was no longer present in her conscious mind.

A single-centre cost comparison analysis of collagenase injection versus surgical fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture of the hand.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The options for treating patients with Dupuytren's contracture have broadened with the introduction of collagenase. Although the literature would suggest that collagenase treatment is effective, has few complications and is popular with patients, it has not been widely commissioned by the National Health Services of the United Kingdom and other European countries due to concerns about cost. The aim of this study was to compare the cost of surgical fasciectomy to collagenase injections for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in a single centre.METHOD: Prospective data on 40 patients undergoing fasciectomy or collagenase injection (20 patients in each group) were collected between January and March 2013. Financial data on the costs of the procedures, equipment, theatre time and follow-up appointments were calculated.RESULTS: The average cost of an open partial fasciectomy pathway was £ 7115.34 and that of a collagenase pathway was £ 2110.62. Eight collagenase patients had physician-led follow-up appointments and only three had hand physiotherapy appointments. By contrast, every fasciectomy patient had at least one physician and one physiotherapist follow-up appointment routinely.CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that collagenase treatment for Dupuytren's contracture of a single digit in selected patients is just over £ 5000 less than treatment for the same condition using surgical fasciectomy. Collagenase-treated patients require much less physician- and physiotherapist-led postoperative follow-up.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",24486152,2014
"Association among work exposure, alcohol intake, smoking and Dupuytren's disease in a large cohort study (GAZEL).","OBJECTIVES: In view of the debate of factors in Dupuytren's disease, we aimed to describe its relationship with certain occupational factors, alcohol intake and smoking.SETTING: The French GAZEL cohort (employees of Electricité de France and Gaz de France).PARTICIPANTS: Participants of the cohort who answered a questionnaire in 2012, that is, 13 587 participants (73.7% of the questionnaire sent). In 2007, self-assessed lifetime occupational biomechanical exposure was recorded (carrying loads, manipulating a vibrating tool and climbing stairs), as well as alcohol intake, smoking and diabetes mellitus. Analyses were performed on high alcohol intake, smoking and duration of relevant work exposure, stratified by gender.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: From a specific question on Dupuytren's disease assessed in 2012, the outcome measures were self-reported Dupuytren's disease (yes/no) and disabling Dupuytren's disease (including surgery).RESULTS: A total of 10 017 men and 3570 women, aged 64-73 years, were included; the mean age for men was 68 years and for women was 65 years. Among men, the following were significantly associated with Dupuytren's disease: age (OR 1.03 (1.00; 1.06)), diabetes (OR 1.31 (1.07; 1.60)), heavy drinking (OR 1.36 (1.10; 1.69)) and over 15 years of manipulating a vibrating tool at work (OR 1.52 (1.15; 2.02)); except for diabetes, the association with these factors was stronger for disabling Dupuytren's disease (or surgery), with OR 1.07 (1.03; 1.11), 1.71 (1.25; 2.33) and 1.98(1.34; 2.91), respectively, for age, heavy drinking and over 15 years of manipulating a vibrating tool at work. Among the 3570 women included, 160 reported Dupuytren's disease (4.5%). The number of cases in the group of women was too low to reach conclusions, although the findings seemed similar for age, diabetes and vibration exposure.CONCLUSIONS: In this large French cohort study, Dupuytren's disease in men was associated with high levels of alcohol consumption and exposure to hand-transmitted vibration. It is likely that the same applied to women.",BMJ open,24477316,2014
"Collagenase clostridium histolyticum in patients with Dupuytren's contracture: results from POINT X, an open-label study of clinical and patient-reported outcomes.","In POINT X, a study designed to reflect clinical practice and patient treatment choices, 254 European patients received open-label collagenase for Dupuytren's contracture. The most severely affected joint was treated first in 74% of patients. In total, 52%, 41%, 7%, and 1% of patients selected the little, ring, middle, and index finger, respectively; 79% had one or two joints treated. Only 9% of patients (n = 24) received 4 or 5 injections. The mean improvement in total passive extension deficit (TPED) was 34° on day 1, improving further by day 7 to 42°. This secondary improvement was maintained by day 90 and month 6. The mean number of injections/joint was 1.2 for the metacarpophalangeal joint and 1.25 for the proximal interphalangeal joint. Median time to recovery was 4 days; the mean improvement in hand function was clinically relevant as measured by the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) score. In total, 87% and 86% of patients and physicians, respectively, were very satisfied or satisfied with treatment at month 6, although correlation between TPED and patient satisfaction was weak (Spearman -0.18, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.06). Collagenase was well tolerated, with 10 (3.9%) patients experiencing severe adverse events. As a real-world study, the POINT X findings can be generalized to the at-large population.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",24470559,2014
Dupuytren's contracture and occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration.,"AIMS: The relation between Dupuytren's contracture and occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) has frequently been debated. We explored associations in a representative national sample of workers with well-characterised exposure to HTV.METHODS: We mailed a questionnaire to 21 201 subjects aged 16-64 years, selected at random from the age-sex registers of 34 general practices in Great Britain and to 993 subjects chosen randomly from military pay records, asking about occupational exposure to 39 sources of HTV and about fixed flexion contracture of the little or ring finger. Analysis was restricted to men at work in the previous week. Estimates were made of average daily vibration dose (A(8) root mean squared velocity (rms)) over that week. Associations with Dupuytren's contracture were estimated by Poisson regression, for lifetime exposure to HTV and for exposures in the past week &gt;A(8) of 2.8 ms(-2) rms. Estimates of relative risk (prevalence ratio (PR)) were adjusted for age, smoking status, social class and certain manual activities at work.RESULTS: In all 4969 eligible male respondents supplied full information on the study variables. These included 72 men with Dupuytren's contracture, 2287 with occupational exposure to HTV and 409 with A(8)&gt;2.8 ms(-2) in the past week. PRs for occupational exposure to HTV were elevated 1.5-fold. For men with an A(8)&gt;2.8 ms(-2) in the past week, the adjusted PR was 2.85 (95% CI 1.37 to 5.97).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that risk of Dupuytren's contracture is more than doubled in men with high levels of weekly exposure to HTV.",Occupational and environmental medicine,24449599,2014
Dupuytren's contracture: an analysis of outcomes of percutaneous needle fasciotomy versus open fasciectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) is a minimally invasive technique used to manage Dupuytren's contracture. We compared outcomes of PNF versus open fasciectomy (OF) to examine the suitability of PNF in Australia.METHOD: A retrospective cohort study using two questionnaires regarding Dupuytren's treatment was used to assess patients with uncomplicated primary disease. The primary outcomes were immediate and medium-term correction of contracture (2-year mean follow-up to time of survey). Secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction and complications including tendon/nerve injury, infection, skin necrosis and vascular damage.RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five out of 191 surveys were returned (81%). The final analysis included 125 cases (65%), 73 PNF and 52 OF. No significant differences were observed between both groups with regards to follow-up time, gender, smoking status, co-morbidities or preoperative deformity grade. No significant differences were observed in terms of immediate or medium-term deformity correction, tendon/nerve injury or circulatory complications. The postoperative infection rate was higher with OF, with these patients 7.57 (95% confidence interval 1.56, 36.77; P = 0.01) times as likely to have a postoperative infection as patients undergoing PNF. A higher number of patients who underwent PNF were told that they would require another operation (30% versus 12%; P = 0.02). Satisfaction scores were similar (OF 33.2 versus PNF 32.6; P = 0.82).CONCLUSION: The OF and PNF procedures provide comparable deformity correction for uncomplicated primary Dupuytren's disease in the immediate perioperative period. The reduced side effect profile of PNF should prompt surgeons to consider incorporating it in their practice for the first-line management of uncomplicated primary Dupuytren's disease.",ANZ journal of surgery,24438029,2014
Costs for collagenase injections compared with fasciectomy in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture: a retrospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare collagenase injections and surgery (fasciectomy) for Dupuytren's contracture (DC) regarding actual total direct treatment costs and short-term outcomes.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: Orthopaedic department of a regional hospital in Sweden.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or older with previously untreated DC of 30° or greater in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the small, ring or middle finger. The collagenase group comprised 16 consecutive patients treated during the first 6 months following the introduction of collagenase as treatment for DC at the study centre. The controls were 16 patients randomly selected among those operated on with fasciectomy at the same centre during the preceding 3 years.INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with collagenase was given during two standard outpatient clinic visits (injection of 0.9 mg, distributed at multiple sites in a palpable cord, and next-day finger extension under local anaesthesia) followed by night-time splinting. Fasciectomy was carried out in the operating room (day surgery) under general or regional anaesthesia using standard technique, followed by therapy and splinting.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Actual total direct costs (salaries of all medical personnel involved in care, medications, materials and other relevant costs), and total MCP and PIP extension deficit (degrees) measured by hand therapists at 6-12 weeks after the treatment.RESULTS: Collagenase injection required fewer hospital outpatient visits to a therapist and nurse than fasciectomy. Total treatment cost for collagenase injection was US$1418.04 and for fasciectomy US$2102.56. The post-treatment median (IQR) total extension deficit was 10 (0-30) for the collagenase group and 10 (0-34) for the fasciectomy group.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of DC with one collagenase injection costs 33% less than fasciectomy with equivalent efficacy at 6 weeks regarding reduction in contracture.",BMJ open,24435894,2014
The Southampton Dupuytren's Scoring Scheme.,"The aim of this study was to construct and validate a simple patient-related outcome score to quantify the disability caused by Dupuytren's disease (DD), thus enabling prioritisation of treatment, to allow reliable audit of surgical outcome and to support future research. The Southampton Dupuytren's Scoring System (SDSS) was developed in a staged fashion according to the recommendations of The Derby Outcomes Conference. (1) Item generation; (2) Item reduction; (3) Internal consistency; (4) Test-re-test; (5) Field management; (6) Sensitivity to change standardised response mean; and (7) Criterion validity: ability of the SDSS to measure what it is supposed to measure. Internal consistency measured with Cronbach's alpha indicated acceptable reliability. The test-re-test correlation coefficient showed high reliability with SDSS. Field-testing showed SDSS ratings to be higher than the QuickDASH (Disability of the arm, shoulder and hand) ratings evaluated by the patients who answered both questionnaires. Standardised response mean was more sensitive for SDSS compared with QuickDASH showing sensitivity to change. Criterion validity was used to assess if the SDSS was measuring what it is supposed to measure comparing the SDSS with QuickDASH. A highly significant correlation was found between the two scoring systems. SDSS is a disease-specific patient-related outcome measure with a good internal consistency and performs better than QuickDASH in terms of test-re-test reliability and sensitivity to change. SDSS shows better field-testing attributes suggesting that it is a relatively more patient and practitioner friendly scoring system. This study proposes to the SDSS is a useful patient-related outcome measure for DD.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,24428161,2014
[Dupuytren's disease].,"Dupuytren's disease, first described in 1831 by G. Dupuytren, is a mysterious retractile fibrosis of the palmodigital aponeurosis. Its etiology remains unclear despite various risk factors identified including genetics factors. Most patients are middle age males and have Caucasian's origin (northern Europe). Among risk factors, diabetes is the most frequent associated disease. Characteristic clinical signs are the palmar nodules, ombilications and cords causing finger contractures. There is various clinical features with also ectopic signs: Ledderhose's disease, Lapeyronie's disease and dorsal pads. There is no conservative treatment. The treatment is justified when the patient can't put his hand flat on the table (Hueston's test). Therapeutic strategy depends on the extent and level of retractions. Needle fasciotomy is preferred for palmar forms. Surgery (fasciectomy) is the standard procedure for digitopalmar forms because of complexity of band's anatomy and its proximity with the neurovascular bundle. Enzymatic fasciotomy using collagenase injections have been recently developped. Published results are hopeful and assessment in Europe is underway. Anyhow the used technique, recurrence is frequent and can be treated by dermofasciectomy. Palliative surgery, as arthrodesis, can be necessary in case of recurrency.",La Revue du praticien,24422298,2014
Prevalence and risk factors of five most common upper extremity disorders in diabetics.,"BACKGROUND: In addition to macrovascular and along with other microvascular complications, diabetic patients suffer from some common musculoskeletal complications. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of five musculoskeletal disorders of upper extremity including shoulder capsulitis (SC), limited joint mobility (LJM), Dupuytren's contracture (DC), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), and trigger finger (TF) as well as identify their related risk factors in diabetic patients.METHODS: We recruited 432 types 1 or 2 diabetic patients and evaluated them for the presence of musculoskeletal disorders and their-related risk factors in 2012-13. The patients were examined by an endocrinologist and then suspected subjects evaluated by a rheumatologist for defining final diagnosis.RESULTS: The most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder of upper extremity was SC (8.79%), followed by CTS (8.56%), LJM (6.94%), DC (7.4%), and TF (6.71%). Advanced age, female sex, smoking, and duration of diabetes were associated with the appearance of SC; female sex and duration of diabetes with CTS; advanced age and smoking with LJM; advanced age, duration of diabetes and history of foot ulcer with DC; and history of laser photocoagulation was associated with TF.CONCLUSIONS: The results show lower prevalence of upper musculoskeletal disorders and different associated risk factors in our diabetic population in comparison with previous studies on other populations.",Journal of research in health sciences,24402858,2014
The efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum in the treatment of patients with moderate Dupuytren's contracture.,"OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) in patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) was demonstrated in a program including two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials (CORD I and II) which included patients with a broad range of disease severity. This analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of CCH in the subpopulation of DC patients with up to two joints affected and moderate disease according to British Society of Surgery of the Hand classification. This was in support of a resubmission to the Scottish Medicines Consortium.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A post-hoc analysis that included data from patients with up to two joints affected and moderate disease treated with CCH during the randomized and open-label phases of CORD I and II.RESULTS: Of 362 patients who received CCH during the two trials, 58 had one or two joints affected and moderate disease. Sixty-seven joints were treated; 49 patients received treatment for one joint, and 9 patients received treatment for two joints. Each patient received an average of 1.62 injections of CCH per joint. Of 65 evaluable joints, 82% met the primary endpoint of clinical success (reduction in contracture to ≤5° of full extension 30 days after the last injection). This was similar if only primary joints were considered (81% achieved clinical success). Recurrence at 12 months (increase in joint contracture to ≥20° in the presence of a palpable cord in joints that had attained clinical success) was observed in 3.8% of joints. Reported adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity; none resulted in discontinuation.CONCLUSIONS: CORD I and II show that CCH is well tolerated and effective in the treatment of DC in a broad population. The present analysis suggests that CCH has particular value in patients with moderate severity disease and up to two joints affected.STUDY LIMITATIONS: This analysis used data from both the randomized and open-label phases of CORD I and II; therefore, it is not possible to present comparative data for this subpopulation. As this was a post-hoc analysis in a relatively small patient subpopulation, statistical comparisons with the full population were not considered appropriate. Furthermore, the small sample size means that additional subgroup analyses, for example of patients by previous treatment or number of injections administered, are not appropriate. Nevertheless, the data presented demonstrate that CCH is both well tolerated and effective in this population when managed by appropriately trained individuals.",Current medical research and opinion,24397625,2014

"Expression of gap junction proteins connexins 26, 30, and 43 in Dupuytren's disease.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign fibroproliferative process of the palmar aponeurosis showing similarities to wound healing. Communication of cells involved in wound healing is mediated by the composition of gap junction (GJ) proteins. We investigated the expression of 3 GJ proteins, connexins 26, 30, and 43 (Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43) in DD.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fragments of Dupuytren's tissue from 31 patients (mean age 56 (30-76) years, 24 male) were analyzed immunohistochemically and compared to control tissue for expression of the GJ proteins Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43 and also alfa-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).RESULTS: 14 of 31 samples could be attributed to the involutional phase (α-SMA positive) whereas 17 samples had to be considered cords in the residual phase (α-SMA negative). Expression of Cx26 and Cx43 was seen in 12 of the 14 samples from the involutional phase, and Cx30 was seen in 7 of these. Only 4 of the 17 samples from the residual phase showed any Cx, and there was none in the controls.INTERPRETATION: The high expression of GJ proteins Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43 in α-SMA positive myofibroblast-rich nodules, which are characteristic of the active involutional phase of DD, suggests that connexins could be a novel treatment target for the treatment of DD.",Acta orthopaedica,24359029,2013
Efficacy and safety of concurrent collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections for multiple Dupuytren contractures.,"PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of 2 concurrent injections of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) in the same hand to treat multiple Dupuytren flexion contractures.METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label phase IIIb study, 60 patients received two 0.58-mg CCH doses injected into cords affecting 2 joints in the same hand during 1 visit, followed by finger extension approximately 24 hours later. Efficacy at postinjection day 30 (change in flexion contracture and active range of motion, patient satisfaction, physician-rated improvement, and rates of clinical success [flexion contracture 5° or less]) and adverse events were summarized.RESULTS: The concurrent injections were most commonly administered in cords affecting metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints on the same finger (47%) or 2 MCP joints on different fingers of the same hand (37%). Mean total (sum of the 2 treated joints) flexion contracture decreased 76%, from 87° to 24° (MCP joints: 86%; PIP joints: 66%). Mean total range of motion increased from 100° to 161°. Clinical success was 76% for MCP joints and 33% for PIP joints. Most patients were very satisfied (60%) or quite satisfied (28%) with treatment. Most investigators rated treated joints as very much improved (55%) or much improved (37%). The most common treatment-related adverse events (&gt; 75% of patients) were contusion, pain in extremity, and edema peripheral (local edema). Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Serious complications included 1 pulley rupture related to study medication and 1 flexor tendon rupture (following conclusion of the study). There were no systemic complications.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that 2 affected joints can be effectively and safely treated with concurrent CCH injections. There was an increased incidence of some adverse events with concurrent treatment (pruritus, lymphadenopathy, blood blister, and skin laceration) compared with treatment of a single joint. High degrees of patient satisfaction and physician-rated improvement were reported.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,24315486,2013
The anatomy and function of Cleland's ligaments.,"The cutaneous ligaments of the digits have been recognized by anatomists for several centuries, but the best known description is that of John Cleland. Subsequent varying descriptions of their morphology have resulted in the surgical community having an imprecise view of their structure and dynamic function. We micro-dissected 24 fresh frozen fingers to analyze the individual components of Cleland's ligamentous system. Arising from the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, proximal, and sometimes middle phalanx, we found strong ligaments that ran proximally (PIP-P) and distally (PIP-D). On each side of each finger there was a PIP-P ligament present, which passed obliquely from the lateral side of the proximal and sometimes middle phalanx towards its insertion into the skin at the level of the proximal phalanx. The distal (PIP-D) ligaments were found to pass obliquely distally on the radial and ulnar aspects of the digit towards cutaneous insertions around the middle phalanx. A similar arrangement exists more distally with fibres originating from the DIP joint and middle phalanx (the DIP-P pass obliquely proximally, and the DIP-D, distally). Each individual PIP ligament consisted of three different layers originating from fibres overlying the flexor tendon sheath, periosteum or joint capsule, and extensor expansion. Ligaments arising at the DIP joint had two layers equivalent to the anterior two layers of the proximal ligaments. Cleland's ligaments act as skin anchors maintaining the skin in a fixed relationship to the underlying skeleton during motion and functional tasks. They also prevent the skin from 'bagging', protect the neurovascular bundle, and create a gliding path for the lateral slips of the extensor tendon.

Down-regulation of collagen synthesis and matrix metalloproteinase expression in myofibroblasts from Dupuytren nodule using adenovirus-mediated relaxin gene therapy.,"Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative connective tissue disorder characterized by contracture of the palmer fascia of the hand. Relaxin (RLN) is a multifunctional factor which contributes to the remodeling of the pelvic ligament by inhibiting fibrosis and inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the RLN gene on the inhibition of fibrosis in myofibroblastic cells. Myofibroblast cells with adenovirus LacZ (Ad-LacZ) as a marker gene or adenovirus relaxin (Ad-RLN) as therapeutic gene showed transgene expressions in beta-galactosidase assay and Western blot analysis. Myofibroblastic cells with Ad-RLN demonstrated a 22% and 48% reduction in collagen I and III mRNA expressions respectively, a 50% decrease in MMP-1, 70% decrease in MMP-2, 80% decrease in MMP-9, and a 15% reduction in MMP-13 protein expression compared with cultures with viral control and saline control. In addition, myofibroblastic cells with Ad-RLN showed a 40% decrease in TIMP 1 and a 15% increase in TIMP 3 protein expression at 48 h compared to cultures with viral control and saline control. Also, myofibroblastic cell with Ad-RLN demonstrated a 74% inhibition of fibronectin and a 52% decrease in total collagen synthesis at 48 h compared with cultures with viral control and saline control. In conclusion, the RLN gene render antifibrogenic effect on myofibroblastic cells from Dupuytren's nodule via direct inhibition of collagen synthesis not through collagenolytic pathway such as MMP-1, -13, TIMP 1, and 3. Therefore relaxin can be an alternative therapeutic strategy in initial stage of Dupuytren's disease by its antifibrogenic effect.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,24293067,2013
Needle aponeurotomy for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"PNA is one of many treatments available for the treatment of hand contractures resulting from Dupuytren’s disease.

The procedure is safe and easily tolerated by patients, but there is a high rate of recurrence.",Hand clinics,24286740,2013
Collagenase injections for treatment of Dupuytren disease.,"Palmodigital fasciectomy remains the gold standard. The initial outcome is, in my experience, far more predictable than either NA or enzyme fasciotomy (EF). It is also a more durable treatment. NA and EF can be conceptualized as similar procedures--one uses a needle and the other an enzyme to weaken a cord sufficient to be able to rupture it and thus straighten a contracted joint. Both are less invasive and the hand is quick to recover. Both procedures are equally initially effective. CHH seems to offer greater durability. Today’s patients are often better educated and seek a specific type of treatment, in particular, effective nonoperative treatment. Pharmaceutical companies now market directly and effectively to patients, and this strategy and Internet use have already resulted in an increase in the number of patients searching for practitioners willing to administer and capable of administering collagenase treatment.",Hand clinics,24286739,2013
Eliciting health state utilities for Dupuytren's contracture using a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An internet-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted to elicit preferences for a wide range of Dupuytren's contracture (DC)-related health states. An algorithm was subsequently developed to convert these preferences into health state utilities that can be used to assess DC's impact on quality of life and the value of its treatments.METHODS: Health state preferences for varying levels of DC hand severity were elicited via an internet survey from a sample of the UK adult population. Severity levels were defined using a combination of contractures (0, 45, or 90 degrees) in 8 proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Right-handed, left-handed, and ambidextrous respondents indicated which hand was preferable in each of the 10 randomly-selected hand-pairings comparing different DC severity levels. For consistency across comparisons, anatomically precise digital hand drawings were used. To anchor preferences onto the traditional 0-1 utility scale used in health economic evaluations, unaffected hands were assigned a utility of 1.0 whereas the utility for a maximally affected hand (i.e., all 8 joints set at 90 degrees of contracture) was derived by asking respondents to indicate what combination of attributes and levels of the EQ-5D-5L profile most accurately reflects the impact of living with such hand. Conditional logistic models were used to estimate indirect utilities, then rescaled to the anchor points on the EQ-5D-5L.RESULTS: Estimated utilities based on the responses of 1,745 qualified respondents were 0.49, 0.57, and 0.63 for completely affected dominant hands, non-dominant hands, or ambidextrous hands, respectively. Utility for a dominant hand with 90-degree contracture in t h e metacarpophalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers was estimated to be 0.89. Separately, reducing the contracture of metacarpophalangeal joint for a little finger from 50 to 12 degrees would improve utility by 0.02.INTERPRETATION: DC is associated with substantial utility decrements. The algorithms presented herein provide a robust and flexible framework to assess utility for varying degrees of DC severity.",Acta orthopaedica,24286567,2013
"Dupuytren disease: European hand surgeons, hand therapists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians agree on a multidisciplinary treatment guideline: results from the HANDGUIDE study.","BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary treatment guidelines for Dupuytren disease can aid in optimizing the quality of care for patients with this disorder. Therefore, this study aimed to achieve consensus on a multidisciplinary treatment guideline for Dupuytren disease.METHODS: A European Delphi consensus strategy was initiated. A systematic review reporting on the effectiveness of interventions was conducted and used as an evidence-based starting point for this study. In total, 39 experts (hand surgeons, hand therapists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians) participated in the Delphi consensus strategy. Each Delphi round consisted of a questionnaire, an analysis, and a feedback report.RESULTS: After four Delphi rounds, consensus was achieved on the description, symptoms, and diagnosis of Dupuytren disease. No nonsurgical interventions were included in the guideline. Needle and open fasciotomy, and a limited fasciectomy and dermofasciectomy, were seen as suitable surgical techniques for Dupuytren disease. Factors relevant for choosing one of these surgical techniques were identified and divided into patient-related (age, comorbidity), disease-related (palpable cord, previous surgery in the same area, skin involvement, time of recovery, recurrences), and surgeon-related (years of experience) factors. Associations of these factors with the choice of a specific surgical technique were reported in the guideline. Postsurgical rehabilitation should always include instructions and exercise therapy; postsurgical splinting should be performed on indication.

Its prevalence has been the subject of several reviews; however, an accurate description of the prevalence range in the general population--and of the relation between age and disease--is lacking.METHODS: Embase and PubMed were searched using database-specific Medical Subject Headings; titles and abstracts were searched for the words &quot;Dupuytren,&quot; &quot;incidence,&quot; and &quot;prevalence.&quot; Two reviewers independently assessed the articles using inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rated the included studies with a quality assessment instrument. In a meta-analysis, the median prevalence, as a function of age by sex, was estimated, accompanied by 95 percent prediction intervals. The observed heterogeneity in prevalence was investigated with respect to study quality and geographic location.RESULTS: Twenty-three of 199 unique identified articles were included. The number of participants ranged from 37 to 97,537, and age ranged from 18 to 100 years. Prevalence varied from 0.6 to 31.6 percent. The quality of studies differed but could not explain the heterogeneity among studies. Mean prevalence was estimated as 12, 21, and 29 percent at ages 55, 65, and 75 years, respectively, based on the relation between age and prevalence determined from 10 studies.CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe a prevalence range of Dupuytren disease in the general population of Western countries. The relation between age and prevalence of Dupuytren disease is given according to sex, including 95 percent prediction intervals. It is possible to determine disease prevalence at a certain age for the total population, and for men and women separately.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,24263394,2013
Efficacy and safety of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injection for Dupuytren contracture: report of 40 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative pathology that affects the palmar aponeurosis causing the development of nodules and collagen cords and the progressive flexion of the fingers. The standard procedure is surgical fasciectomy, followed by high recurrence rates. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection represents an innovative noninvasive approach to the treatment of DD. This prospective study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of CCH injection performed in the outpatient, using local anesthesia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients [32 metacarpophalangeal (MP), 8 proximal interphalangeal (PIP)] with Dupuytren's contracture of at least 20° for MP joint and any degree for PIP joint were included. The mean age was 66. All joints were treated with a single vial of collagenase injection and manual breaking of the cord 24 h after. All adverse effects (AEs) were monitored. Patients were checked 7, 30, 90, and 180 days after the injection. Primary endpoint was a reduction in digit contracture within 0°-5° of normal extension. Secondary endpoints were the improvement of range of motion, the evaluation of AEs incidence, and cost-effectiveness of collagenase treatment.RESULTS: About 67.5 % of patients obtained a clinical success. At 6 months, a further 7.5% attained the same result. The mean contracture of treated joints was 5.3º for MP and 6.8° for PIP joints. Twenty-three patients had one or more mild-to-moderate side effects.CONCLUSIONS: The use of collagenase appears to be an effective and safe method for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Therapeutic success was achieved in a significant percentage of patients. The incidence of side effects was higher, but they were local reactions of short duration. The use of a single collagenase vial in patients treated in day surgery appears more cost-effective than surgery.",Musculoskeletal surgery,24254968,2013
Disorders of the hand: a case study approach.,"Using a case study approach, 2 disorders of the hands are presented. Dupuytren's contractures and bilateral trigger finger are described with a discussion of the interventions, including injection and surgical repair. Dupuytren's disease is a contracture of the connective tissue in the hand. It is also known as palmar fibromatosis and can occur bilaterally. This is a progressive disorder and causes deformity of the hands and eventually results in a decrease of functionality. Trigger finger is a common finger ailment that also causes deformity of the hand. This disorder is often referred to as stenosing tenosynovitis and can occur in several fingers bilaterally. The inflammation and hypertrophy of the sheath restricts the motion of the flexor tendon that results in triggering of the affected finger. It is painful and disabling. The etiology, prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing care of these disorders are discussed. ",Orthopedic nursing,24247305,2013
Squamous cell carcinoma and ledderhose disease: a case report.,"Ledderhose disease is disorder of the plantar aponeurosis. This disease is not so common and can be tackled with a surgical or conservative approach. A case of a 73-year-old man came to our attention who had a 26-year history of painless bilateral plantar nodules coalescing into an indurated mass. An ulcerative nodule had been noted in the last 16 months on the right foot, in the absence of trauma, not responsive to conservative treatment, so we decided to perform a biopsy. The histopatologic examination showed squamous cell carcinoma, with warty, well-differentiated, low-grade malignancy. Surgical treatment was suggested, so, in pneumoischemia, we made a surgical incision including the skin lesion. Then we proceeded to sculpture the anterolateral thigh fasciacutaneous flap to obtain adequate soft tissue coverage. The tumor was completely removed. Current reconstructive possibilities comprise a good anatomofunctional recovery even in the case of large demolition requests for the therapy of advanced cases of the disease described in this article. Correlation between Ledderhose disease and the formation of malignant tumors has not been made as yet, but perhaps an element that could unite these pathologies can be researched in the lively cell proliferation that characterizes both. It would be interesting to analyze the biological substrate, as well as the systemic and local levels, in patients where both diseases are manifested.

[News in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease: from surgery to collagenase's injection].,"Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibromatosis affecting the palmar and digital fascia and causing flexion contracture of the affected fingers. Up to date, this affection has no curative treatment available. The author is presenting an updated review of the therapeutic arsenal available for Dupuytren's disease cords correction. Open fasciectomy remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; surgical treatment of the disease but enzymatic treatment of the cords by injected collagenase clostridium histolyticum represents a promising new therapeutic. Recent published data are showing that this procedure gives comparable results to the published ones for segmental fasciectomy in terms of cords correction and recurrence prevention but with the advantage of a quicker recovery with a minimal morbidity.",Revue medicale de Bruxelles,24195241,2013
Cleland's ligaments and Dupuytren's disease.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether Cleland's ligaments are affected by Dupuytren's disease and assess their contribution to the flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Twenty patients with Dupuytren's disease undergoing fasciectomy for a PIP joint contracture &gt; 40° (mean 61°, range 45°-100°) were included. After excision of all other identifiable digital disease, Cleland's ligaments were assessed. If they appeared to be macroscopically affected by Dupuytren's disease they were excised, sent for histological analysis, and any further improvement of PIP joint contracture was recorded. There were 14 males and six females with a mean age of 62 (range 40-79) years. Excision of Cleland's ligaments resulted in a mean further correction of 7° (range 0°-15°). Histological analysis indicated that Cleland's ligament was clearly involved with Dupuytren's disease in 12 patients, indicating that Cleland's ligaments can be affected by Dupuytren's disease. In the remaining specimens the histological findings were equivocal. As these structures are situated dorsal to the neurovascular bundles, a specific dissection has to be undertaken to identify them. Excision of Cleland's ligaments at digital fasciectomy further avoids leaving residual disease and may yield a worthwhile further correction of PIP joint flexion contracture.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",24194613,2013
Treatment of stages IIIIV of the Dupuytrens Disease using a personal approach: percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) and minimal invasive selective aponeurectomy.,"The authors present their experience in treating 23 fingers on 20 patients affected by Dupuytrens Disease in stages III and IV of the Tubiana classification with their personal technique that involves the percutaneous needle fasciotomy followed 40 days after by a selective open aponeurectomy on the previously treated cord, by making a small cutaneous incision. The treatment requires careful selection of the patients. In fact, patients suffering from the disease for more than 5 years and all the cases with a suspicion of joint rigidity are excluded from the study. The average follow up period was approximately 48 months. 18 out of the 20 patients had excellent functional recovery. Skin grafts or local flaps are not required after selective aponeurectomy with these surgical steps. The advantages of this technique include its simplicity, minimal discomfort to patients, rapid functional recovery, low recurrence rate and low cost.",Acta chirurgiae plasticae,24188318,2013
Breaking the rules: Dupuytren's disease under Skoog's fibres.,"Skoog and others have concluded that the Skoog fibres, or transverse ligament of the palmar aponeurosis (TLPA), are never involved in the Dupuytren's disease process. Here we present a case in which this clearly occurs. Whilst for the vast majority of Dupuytren's cases the Skoog's fibres delineate the required deep extent of dissection for pretendinous cords, this case proves an exception, highlighting an occasional need to beware of accepting the conventional wisdom.

Response of dupuytren fibroblasts to different oxygen environments.,"PURPOSE: It is thought that local ischemia and oxygen radicals are responsible for fibroblast-to-myofibroblast cell transformation and proliferation. We hypothesized that hypoxia could differentially activate the contractility of fibroblasts from normal human palmar fascia and from fibroblasts-myofibroblasts of Dupuytren cords.METHODS: Normal palmar fascia from 5 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and Dupuytren cords from 5 patients were harvested. Cells were cultured from all tissue samples, and collagen lattices were prepared containing these cells. Oxygen treatment subgroups were created and incubated under hypoxic (1% O(2), 5% CO(2), and 94% N(2)), normoxic (21% O(2), 5% CO(2), and 74% N(2)), and hyperoxic (100% oxygen using 2.4 atm pressure twice a day for 7 d) conditions. After 7 days, each subgroup was photographed, and lattices were released from dishes. Postrelease photographs were taken immediately, 5 minutes after release, and after 1 hour. Areas of the lattices at each time point were calculated using MetaMorph software. Actin staining and live/dead cell analysis was performed. Linear repeated measures analysis of variance was used for data analysis given that contraction levels were measured over 3 distinct time points.RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference between normal samples and Dupuytren samples in mean contraction levels over time. There was no statistically significant difference between tissue groups over the 3 time periods based on the oxygen treatment received.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a greater degree of contractility in Dupuytren disease cells than normal fibroblasts. However, the contraction in either group was not affected by oxygen level. Future in vivo research is needed to better understand the nature of pathophysiology of Dupuytren disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,24140364,2013
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum for dupuytren contracture: patterns of use and effectiveness in clinical practice.,"PURPOSE: To collect data on the real-world effectiveness of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) during its first year of use following U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and compare those results with clinical trial efficacy data.METHODS: This retrospective chart review was conducted at 10 U.S. community and academic practice sites with major experience using CCH. Charts of patients treated with CCH between February and December 2010 were abstracted, and anonymized data were analyzed. Clinical use, including number of injections per cord and effectiveness outcomes (joint contracture and range of motion) were compared with results from 2 registration trials.RESULTS: Data were collected from 501 patients (74% male; 48% employed; mean [SD] age, 65 [10] y); 463 patients had sufficient data for analysis. We found that 1.08 CCH injections were used per treated joint, compared with a mean of 1.7 injections in registration trials. Ninety-three percent of joints received only 1 injection. The mean (SD) number of visits per injection was 2.92 (1.0). Mean (SD) contracture was reduced by 75% from 49° (21) at baseline to 12° (17), similar to the 71% to 79% reduction in clinical trials. Mean (SD) range of motion was improved by 37° from 44° (20) at baseline to 81° (14), similar to the increase of 35° and 37° in the 2 clinical trials; and 67% of first injections resulted in full correction to 0° to 5°, compared with the clinical trial rate of 39%.CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lower injection rate, correction of joint contracture and range of motion was similar to findings from clinical trials. Effectiveness reports using this kind of surveillance design could provide patients, physicians, and payers with the information needed to make better treatment and reimbursement decisions.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,24140362,2013
Epidemiological study for personal risk factors and quality of life related to Dupuytren's disease in a mountain village of Japan.,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the etiology, personal risk factors, and quality of life related to Dupuytren's disease among residents of a mountain village in Japan.METHODS: Medical examinations were conducted of 401 adult residents (163 men, 238 women; average age of 66.7 years, range 40-92) of a mountain village in Japan. All had completed a self-administered questionnaire including items for gender, weight, height, dominant hand, occupation, history of diabetes mellitus, and frequency of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol, in addition to EuroQol-5-Dimensions-3-level Japanese version. Blood samples were collected and assessed for biochemical markers related to Dupuytren's disease. The Dupuytren's disease diagnosis was based on clinical signs. Meyerding's classification was used to ascertain the disease severity. After examining background data and physical examination data related to Dupuytren's disease, we evaluated the association of Dupuytren's disease with those factors using univariate and logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Dupuytren's disease was diagnosed in 28 subjects (7.0%). Univariate analysis revealed associations of age, male gender, occupation, history of diabetes mellitus, and alcohol intake with Dupuytren's disease. Logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age revealed a significant association between Dupuytren's disease and male gender, occupation, and history of alcohol intake. No significant difference was found between Dupuytren's disease patients and participants without this disease in the scoring and visual analog scale of EuroQol. No relation was found in scoring, the visual analog scale of EuroQol, or grading of Meyerding's classification in participants with Dupuytren's disease.CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed Dupuytren's disease in 7.0% of 401 subjects among the general population of a mountain village in Japan. The prevalence is higher with age and is apparently associated with male gender, occupation and alcohol intake. Risk factors associated with Dupuytren's disease were identified as age, male gender, occupation, and alcohol consumption habits.",Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,24129389,2013
Use of resources and costs associated with the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture at an orthopedics and traumatology surgery department in Denia (Spain): collagenase clostridium hystolyticum versus subtotal fasciectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to analyze and compare the use of direct health resources and costs generated in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture using two different techniques: subtotal fasciectomy and infiltration with Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH) in regular clinical practice at the Orthopedic and Traumatology Surgery (OTS) Department at the Hospital de Denia (Spain).METHODS: Observational, retrospective study based on data from the computerized clinical histories of two groups of patients- those treated surgically using a one or two digit subtotal fasciectomy technique (FSC) and those treated with CCH infiltration, monitored in regular clinical practice from February, 2009 to May, 2012. Demographic (age, sex), clinical (number of digits affected and which ones) and use of resources (hospitalizations, medical visits, tests and drugs) data were collected. Resource use and associated costs, according to the hospital's accounting department, were compared based on the type of treatment from Spain's National Health Service.RESULTS: 91 patients (48 (52.8%) in the FSC group) were identified. The average age and number of digits affected was 65.9 (9.2) years and 1.33 (0.48) digits affected in the FSC group, and 65.1 (9.7) years and 1.16 (0.4) digits in the CCH group.Overall, the costs of treating Dupuytren's disease with subtotal FSC amount to €1,814 for major ambulatory surgery and €1,961 with hospital stay including admission, surgical intervention (€904), examinations, dressings and physiotherapy. As to collagenase infiltration, costs amount to €952 (including minor surgery admission, vial with product, office examination and dressings). Finally, comparing total costs for treatments, a savings of €388 is estimated in favor of CCH treatment in the best-case scenario (patient under MAS system with no need for physiotherapy) and €1,008 in the worst-case scenario (patient admitted to hospital needing subsequent physiotherapy), implying a savings of 29% and 51%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that treating patients with DC by injection with CCH at the OTS department of the Hospital de Denia generates a total savings of 29% and 51% (€388 and €1008) compared with fasciectomy at the time of treatment. Long term evolution of CCH treatment is uncertain and the recurrence rate unknown.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,24125161,2013
[Razemon's lateral digital rotation flap in severe Dupuytren contracture of the fifth finger].,"In Dupuytren's disease, correction of severe contracture deformities and excision of dermal lesions are often responsible for palmar skin defects. This study aimed to assess the results of the lateral digital flap described by Razemon. Thirty-seven patients were analysed retrospectively for functional and trophic results. Twelve months of follow-up were at least required. The lack of extension was appreciated through Thomine's coefficient. Subjective patient's opinion was noted about function of fifth finger and hand. The flap trophicity was evaluated through softness, coverage quality and esthetic aspect. In the preoperative period, the average lack of extension was 105°; 89% of the patients were ranked as stages 3 or 4 of Tubiana's classification. At the 12th month, the average Thomine's coefficient was 0.74; 70% of the patients were very satisfied. Two patients exhibited some lack of suppleness and seven a dyschromic scars. The lateral digital rotation flap is a quite simple surgical procedure. It allows satisfactory results corresponding to functional and trophic coverage in severe Dupuytren's contracture involving the fifth finger. ",Chirurgie de la main,24094664,2013
Hand surgery using local anesthesia.,"Most hand traumas and elective surgical disorders of the hand can be treated quickly, easily, inexpensively, and effectively in an outpatient clinic. Although many surgeons prefer general anesthesia, the senior author routinely uses local anesthesia without sedation almost exclusively for carpal and cubital tunnel release, fasciectomy, arthrodesis, arthroplasty, synovectomy, and trauma, including the repair of tendons, nerves, ligaments, fractures, and soft tissue defects. After completing more than 10,000 procedures, the authors have found great benefits through the use of local anesthesia, which are detailed in the article. ",Clinics in plastic surgery,24093653,2013
Isolated and spontaneous correction of proximal interphalangeal joint contractures in Dupuytren's disease: an exploratory analysis of the efficacy and safety of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dupuytren's contractures affecting proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are challenging to treat. We explored the effects of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) on PIP joint contractures after injection of an affected metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint in the same finger and after injection of an isolated PIP joint contracture.METHODS: Two patient subsets were evaluated: those with MP/PIP joints contractures in the same finger, but only the MP joint contractures were treated (Group A); and those with isolated PIP joint contractures that were treated (Group B). Endpoints included correction and improvement in contracture. Fixed-flexion contracture (FFC) and range of motion (ROM) were also assessed; adverse events (AEs) were monitored.RESULTS: In Group A, 28 and 43 % of PIP contractures spontaneously corrected after the first and last injection of CCH, respectively, for MP contractures; 40 and 63 %, respectively, improved. In Group B, 31 and 39 % of PIP joint contractures corrected after the first and last injection of CCH, respectively, 56 and 66 %, respectively, improved. In Groups A and B, FFC improvements were largest after the last injection; ROM improvements were largest after the last injection in Group A and third injection in Group B. For 46 and 44 % of patients in Groups A and B, respectively, the first injection was the last injection. In Group B, the median (minimum, maximum) injections/joint was 1.0 (1.0, 4.0). Nearly all patients (98 %) experienced ≥1 AE; most were injection-site reactions.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of CCH for improving PIP joint contracture was similar whether treated in isolation or after treatment of an MP joint contracture.",Clinical drug investigation,24092562,2013
[Dupuytren's disease - patient satisfaction and functional results one year after partial fasciectomy and injection of collagenase].,"INTRODUCTION: The gold standard in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease is the partial fasciectomy (PF). Injection of a collagenase directly into the Dupuytren cord is an alternative method. In contrast to needle fasciotomy, destruction of the cord is achieved enzymatically and not mechanically. 24 h after injection, the treated finger can be extended passively to disrupt the Dupuytren cord.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Functional outcome and patient satisfaction were prospectively analysed in 2 comparable groups of patients with the same stage of disease. Follow-up was one year. Patients in the first group underwent partial fasciectomy (PF) (n=13), whereas patients in the second group were treated by an injection of collagenase (CG) in the diseased tissue (n=14). Besides clinical examination, outcome was evaluated by validated questionnaires (DASH/MHQ) and a customised questionnaire.RESULTS: Extension after PF (mean residual contracture 7.5°) was better than after collagenase injection (mean residual contracture 13.2°). Side-effects like numbness, impaired blood circulation and pain were less after injection of collagenase than after PF and of shorter duration. Recovery of grip strength was faster in the CG than after PF and collagenase injection was regarded as less discomforting. The results of the questionnaires showed a reduction of hand function 1 month after surgery, whereas better results were observed 1 month after collagenase injection. Recovery in the CG was significantly faster than after PF.DISCUSSION: Collagenase injection, as a less invasive technique, has less and milder side-effects than surgery and demonstrated a better total reduction of Dupuytren's contracture initially, although the residual contractures were higher in the CG after follow-up of 1 year. Patient satisfaction was higher after collagenase injection due to subjectively perceived less negative impact and a comparable functional outcome.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",24089298,2013
Common variants of the EPDR1 gene and the risk of Dupuytren’s disease.,"The object of this study was the investigation of 3 common variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ependymin-related gene 1 and its association with the occurrence of Dupuytren's disease. DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral blood of 508 consecutive patients. The control group comprised 515 healthy adults who were age-matched with the Dupuytren's patients. 3 common variants were analysed using TaqMan® genotyping assays and sequencing. The differences in the frequencies of variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms in patients and the control group were statistically tested. Additionally, haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium were analysed for these variants. A statistically significant association was noted between rs16879765_CT, rs16879765_TT and rs13240429_AA variants and Dupuytren's disease. 2 haplotypes: rs2722280_C+rs13240429_A+rs16879765_C and rs2722280_C+rs13240429_G+rs16879765_T were found to be statistically significantly associated with Dupuytren's disease. Moreover, we found that rs13240429 and rs16879765 variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium, while rs2722280 was only in moderate linkage disequilibrium. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of the variants of the gene between the groups with a positive and negative familial history of Dupuytren's disease. In conclusion, results of this study suggest that EPDR1 gene can be added to a growing list of genes associated with Dupuytren's disease development.

A comparison of percutaneous needle fasciotomy and collagenase injection for dupuytren disease.,"PURPOSE: To compare percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) with collagenase injection in the treatment of Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients with Dupuytren disease treated with PNF or collagenase. Range of motion, patient satisfaction, and complications were recorded.RESULTS: There were 29 patients in the collagenase group with mean baseline contractures of 40° for 22 affected metacarpophalangeal joints and 50° for 12 affected proximal interphalangeal joints. The PNF group was composed of 30 patients with mean baseline contractures of 37° for 32 affected metacarpophalangeal joints and 41° for 18 affected proximal interphalangeal joints. All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 months. Clinical success (reduction of contracture within 0° to 5° of normal) was accomplished in 35 of 50 joints (67%) in the PNF group and in 19 of 34 joints (56%) in the collagenase group. Patient satisfaction was similar between groups. Only minor complications were observed, including skin tears, ecchymosis, edema, pruritus, and lymphadenopathy.CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, both PNF and collagenase have similar clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,24060510,2013
Plantar fibromatosis--topical review.,"Morbus Ledderhose is a rare hyperproliferative disease of the plantar fascia, leading to the formation of nodules. Its origin is unknown. No causal therapy is available, and treatment remains symptomatic. Various therapeutic strategies to alleviate symptoms are available and are adapted to the severity of the disease. In early stages, conservative therapy including nonpharmacological, physical, and pharmacological treatments is applied. If the disease progresses, irradiation of the plantar surface, injections of steroids, shock wave therapy, and partial or complete fasciectomy as an ultimate therapy may be indicated. Novel experimental treatment options including application of fibrinolytic agents are currently being tested, but no controlled, randomized long-term studies are available. This review aims to provide a systematic overview of current established procedures and outlines novel experimental strategies for the treatment of morbus Ledderhose, including future avenues to treat this rare disease.",Foot &amp; ankle international,24043350,2013
Angular correction related to excision of specific cords in fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease.,"Named cords were excised sequentially at fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease and the resultant correction in the joint angle was measured intra-operatively in 99 fingers. Eighty-two metacarpophalangeal and 59 proximal interphalangeal joints were affected. At the metacarpophalangeal joint, excision of the central cord resulted in 82% correction in 69 joints, and spiral/lateral cord excision resulted in an additional 12% correction in 10 joints. At the proximal interphalangeal joint, excision of the central cord resulted in 44% correction in 36 joints, spiral/lateral cord excision resulted in an additional 19% correction in 16 joints, and retrovascular cord excision resulted in a further 23% correction in 27 joints. Subsequent division of the accessory collateral ligament resulted in a further 14% correction in 14 joints. Larger pre-operative angles of the proximal interphalangeal joint were associated with a retrovascular cord, and larger combined angles were associated with an increasing number of pathological structures involved. The data explain the complexity of surgery at the proximal interphalangeal joint, where four structures are implicated in causing flexion deformity.

"Expression of VEGF, its receptors, and HIF-1α in Dupuytren's disease.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign fibroproliferative process that affects the palmar fascia. The pathology of DD shows similarities with wound healing and tumor growth; hypoxia and angiogenesis play important roles in both. We investigated the role of angiogenic proteins in DD.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptors vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), hypoxia-inducible factor alfa (HIF-1α), and alfa-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were analyzed immunohistochemically in fragments of excised Dupuytren's tissue from 32 patients. We compared these values to values for expression in a control group.RESULTS: 15 of 32 samples could be attributed to the involutional phase (α-SMA positive), whereas 17 samples were considered to be cords at the residual phase (α-SMA negative). In the involutional phase, the HIF-1α and VEGFR2 expression was statistically significantly higher than in the residual phase and in the controls.INTERPRETATION: Both the VEGFR2 receptor and HIF-1α were expressed in α-SMA positive myofibroblast-rich nodules with characteristics of DD in the active involutional phase. Thus, hypoxia and (subsequently) angiogenesis may have a role in the pathophysiology of DD.",Acta orthopaedica,23992143,2013
Does the gatekeeper model work in hand surgery?,"BACKGROUND: Most managed care plans use a physician &quot;gatekeeper&quot; to control referrals to hand surgeons. The appropriateness of this model for upper extremity complaints has never been challenged. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prior management of patients with elective hand disorders who present to a hand surgery clinic.METHODS: All patients presenting to a tertiary, academic medical center for a new-patient hand surgery evaluation from February 3, 2011, to June 15, 2011, were prospectively enrolled. Patients were evaluated for prior provider, diagnosis, treatment, and complications. Actual diagnosis, recommended workup, and appropriate treatment were determined independently by two experienced hand examiners. Traumatic injuries and surgeon disagreements in diagnosis and treatment were excluded, leaving 125 patients.RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of patients had been evaluated by a primary care provider. Overall, the correct diagnosis was established 34 percent of the time. Nerve compression syndromes were diagnosed with the greatest accuracy (64 percent), whereas stenosing tenosynovitis was diagnosed correctly only 15 percent of the time. Before presentation, 74 percent of patients had undergone a study or intervention. On review, 70 percent of studies/interventions were deemed unnecessary. Advanced imaging was unwarranted in 90 percent of patients who received it. Seventeen percent of patients experienced a complication. Most (67 percent) were caused by a delay in diagnosis, whereas 33 percent resulted from an intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers less familiar with an examination of the hand often misdiagnose and mistreat common problems. A referral system may not be the most efficient means of delivering care to patients with elective hand maladies.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,23985650,2013
Dupuytren disease: on our way to a cure?,"Despite its high prevalence, the clinical presentation and severity of Dupuytren disease is extremely variable. The disease features a broad spectrum of symptoms, from simple nodules without the slightest clinical impact towards an extremely disabling form requiring multiple surgical procedures, sometimes even partial hand amputations. Recurrence after surgery is considered a failure for both patient and surgeon, but its definition is vague. The term 'recontracture' was coined by a patient and reflects the disappointment of recurrent disease. Wether or not a treatment option will insure a definite result, may depend more on the severity of the disease, which is patient specific, than on the treatment method itself. If a patient presents with Dupuytren disease, one should not merely evaluate his hands. Different clinical and personal history features may uncover a severe fibrosis diathesis and both correct information to the patient and an individualized treatment plan are needed. In the near future, a simple genetic test may help to identify patients at risk. Similar to the evolving knowledge and treatment modalities seen in rheumatoid arthritis, treatment of Dupuytren disease is likely to advance in the direction of disease control with pharmacotherapy and single shot minimal invasive enzymatic fasciotomy with collagenase to correct established contractures.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,23926723,2013
Adipose-derived stem cells inhibit the contractile myofibroblast in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: In an attempt to provide minimally invasive treatment for Dupuytren's disease, percutaneous disruption of the affected tissue followed by lipografting is being tested. Contractile myofibroblasts drive this fibroproliferative disorder, whereas stem cells have recently been implicated in preventing fibrosis. Therefore, the authors tested the role of stem cells in modulating myofibroblast activity in Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: The authors compared the effect of co-culturing Dupuytren's myofibroblasts with either adipose-derived or bone-marrow-derived stem cells on isometric force contraction and associated levels of α-smooth muscle actin mRNA and protein expression. The authors also tested the effect of these stem cells on Dupuytren's myofibroblast proliferation and assessed whether this was mediated by cell-to-cell contact or by a paracrine mechanism.RESULTS: Addition of adipose-derived stem cells to Dupuytren's myofibroblasts reduced the contraction of the latter, with a corresponding reduction of α-smooth muscle actin protein expression, probably through a dilution effect. In contrast, bone marrow-derived stem cells increased myofibroblast contractility. In addition, adipose-derived stem cells inhibit myofibroblast proliferation and mediate these effects by soluble factors, influenced by cell-to-cell contact-dependent signaling.CONCLUSION: Adipose-derived stem cells inhibit the contractile myofibroblast in Dupuytren's disease, and these findings lend support to the potential benefit of lipografting in conjunction with aponeurotomy as a novel strategy for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,23924646,2013
Do patient-reported outcome measures capture functioning aspects and environmental factors important to individuals with injuries or disorders of the hand?,"STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study.INTRODUCTION: Clinical outcome evaluation needs to consider the patient perspective for an in-depth understanding of functioning and disability.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To explore whether patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used in the field of hand injuries or hand disorders, capture functioning aspects and environmental factors important to the patients.METHODS: We performed a qualitative study and a systematic literature review. The focus group sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and the identified concepts were linked to the ICF. We searched in MEDLINE for reviews, related to injuries or disorders of the hand, reporting on PROMs. We linked the items of the identified PROMs to the ICF and compared the qualitative data with the content of the PROMs.RESULTS: Statements from 45 individuals who participated in eight focus groups were linked to 97 categories of the ICF. From 15 reviews included, eight PROMs were selected. The selected PROMs capture 34 of the categories retrieved from the qualitative data.CONCLUSIONS: PROMs used in the context of hand injuries or hand disorders capture only in parts the functioning aspects important to the patients.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,23911076,2013
Patterns of recontracture after surgical correction of Dupuytren disease.,"PURPOSE: To study the evolution of deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint over 5 years after good surgical correction of Dupuytren-induced contracture.METHODS: We assessed 63 patients (72 fingers; 69 hands) with Dupuytren disease for the degree of contracture, its correction after surgery, and the range of movement at the proximal interphalangeal joints at 3 and 6 months, and 1, 3, and 5 years after fasciectomy with or without the use of a firebreak graft. We investigated associations between the recurrence of contracture and preoperative patient and surgical factors.RESULTS: There were 4 patterns of evolution of contracture after surgical correction. A total of 31 patients (33 hands) showed good improvement that was maintained for 5 years (minimal recontracture group). Twenty patients (23 hands) showed good initial improvement, which mildly worsened (&lt; 20°) but was then maintained over 5 years (mild early recontracture group). Four patients (5 hands) worsened in first 3 months after surgery (&gt; 20°) but there was no further worsening (severe early recontracture group). Eight patients (8 hands) worsened progressively over 5 years (progressive recontracture group). Worsening of contracture more than 6° between 3 and 6 months after surgery predicted progressive recontracture at 5 years.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of contracture (not disease recurrence) could be predicted as early as 6 months after surgery for Dupuytren disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,23910381,2013
Cost-effectiveness in the management of Dupuytren's contracture. A Canadian cost-utility analysis of current and future management strategies.,"In Canada, Dupuytren's contracture is managed with partial fasciectomy or percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA). Injectable collagenase will soon be available. The optimal management of Dupuytren's contracture is controversial and trade-offs exist between the different methods. Using a cost-utility analysis approach, our aim was to identify the most cost-effective form of treatment for managing Dupuytren's contracture it and the threshold at which collagenase is cost-effective. We developed an expected-value decision analysis model for Dupuytren's contracture affecting a single finger, comparing the cost-effectiveness of fasciectomy, aponeurotomy and collagenase from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness, one-way sensitivity and variability analyses were performed using standard thresholds for cost effective treatment ($50 000 to $100 000/QALY gained). Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy was the preferred strategy for managing contractures affecting a single finger. The cost-effectiveness of primary aponeurotomy improved when repeated to treat recurrence. Fasciectomy was not cost-effective. Collagenase was cost-effective relative to and preferred over aponeurotomy at $875 and $470 per course of treatment, respectively. In summary, our model supports the trend towards non-surgical interventions for managing Dupuytren's contracture affecting a single finger. Injectable collagenase will only be feasible in our publicly funded healthcare system if it costs significantly less than current United States pricing.",The bone &amp; joint journal,23908426,2013
Prevalence of Dupuytren disease in The Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative disease of palmar fascias of the hand. The prevalence of Dupuytren disease and the association with potential risk factors have been the subject of several studies, although there is a paucity of such data from The Netherlands.METHODS: To study the prevalence of Dupuytren disease, the authors drew a random sample of 1360 individuals, stratified by age, from the northern part of The Netherlands. Of this sample, 763 individuals aged 50 to 89 years participated in this cross-sectional study. The authors examined both hands for signs of Dupuytren disease, and a questionnaire was conducted to identify potential risk factors. The effects of these risk factors were investigated using logistic regression analysis. Additional analyses were performed to develop a logistic prediction model for the prevalence of Dupuytren disease.RESULTS: The prevalence of Dupuytren disease was 22.1 percent. Nodules and cords were seen in 17.9 percent, and flexion contractures were present in 4.2 percent of the study population. Prevalence increased with age, from 4.9 percent in participants aged 50 to 55 years to 52.6 percent among those aged 76 to 80 years. Men were more often affected than women; 26.4 percent versus 18.6 percent, respectively (p=0.007). Other significant risk factors were previous hand injury, excessive alcohol consumption, familial occurrence of Dupuytren disease, and presence of Ledderhose disease.CONCLUSIONS: The results show a high prevalence of Dupuytren disease in The Netherlands, particularly the nodular form. Using the developed logistic prediction model, the prevalence of Dupuytren disease can be estimated, based on the presence of significant risk factors.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, III.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,23897337,2013
[Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by collagenase injection].,"Dupuytren's disease is a disorder of the palmar aponeurosis responsible for apparition of pathological collagen cords that will gradually lead to a digital retraction. These cords cause functional disability to the hand with a real handicap for the patient. No curative treatment exists currently in this disease. Injections of collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum cause lysis of the collagen present in the cords and cause an interruption of the palmar cord. It is a new treatment in the management of Dupuytren's disease. The use of collagenase injection in the treatment of palmar form of Dupuytren's disease gives good results in the short and medium terms. It is a simple, minimally invasive treatment, several studies have proven its effectiveness and it approximates percutaneous needle fasciotomy in its easy use and its indications. Patients should be well informed about local reactions and transient pain with the injection of C. histolyticum collagenase. Diffusion of this technique is still limited by: the assessment of its cost compared to that of other methods of treatment and particularly the needle fasciotomy, and the evaluation of results over the long-term.

[Dupuytren's contracture associated with silicone wear reaction in late failure of lunate bone spacer prosthesis].,"The pathophysiological mechanisms of palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's contracture) are still not yet fully understood. In the vast majority of cases, however, reactive changes and reparative processes of tendon tissue can easily be ruled out by clinical and histopathological investigations. This article presents the case of a 62-year-old male patient suffering from palmar fibromatosis associated with a failed silicon spacer of the lunate bone 30 years after index surgery. Although silicon wear particles were observed in distal locations, proximal tendon tissues showed changes consistent with a degenerative palmar fibromatosis in the absence of a pathological wear reaction. The findings are discussed in the light of the current literature on Dupuytren's contracture. ",Der Orthopade,23812208,2013
"The effect of night extension orthoses following surgical release of Dupuytren contracture: a single-center, randomized, controlled trial.","PURPOSE: To clarify the efficacy and detrimental effects of orthoses used to maintain finger extension following surgical release of Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: We conducted a single-center, randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effect of night extension orthoses on finger range of motion and hand function for 3 months following surgical release of Dupuytren contracture. We also wanted to determine how well finger extension was maintained in the total sample. We randomized 56 patients to receive a night extension orthosis plus hand therapy (n = 26) or hand therapy alone (n = 30). The primary outcome was total active extension of the operated fingers (°). Secondary outcomes were total active flexion of the operated fingers (°), active distal palmar crease (cm), grip strength (kg), and self-reported hand function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (0-100 scale).RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the no-orthosis and orthosis groups for total active extension or for any of the secondary outcomes. Between the first postoperative measure and 3 months after surgery, 62% of little fingers had maintained or improved total active extension.CONCLUSIONS: The use of a night extension orthosis in combination with standard hand therapy has no greater effect on maintaining finger extension than hand therapy alone in the 3 months following surgical release of Dupuytren contracture. Our results indicate that the practice of providing every patient with a night extension orthosis following surgical release of Dupuytren contracture may not be justified except for cases in which extension loss occurs after surgery. Our results also challenge clinicians to research ways of maintaining finger extension in a greater number of patients.",The Journal of hand surgery,23790420,2013
Baron Guillaume Dupuytren: Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture of the hand is an extremely common deformity in middle aged and elderly men but it is rarely encountered in women. It usually involves the fifth and fourth fingers, less commonly the other two fingers, and never the thumb. There is a flexion deformity between the head of the metacarpal and the adjacent proximal phalanx and at the proximal interphalangeal joint. However, the distal interphalangeal joint is not affected. Indeed, in a severe case, the distal phalanx may actually be extended as it becomes progressively pressed into the palm of the hand. It is often bilateral and may affect the sole of the foot--although I have only had one old gentleman where his foot lesion troubled him enough for him to request surgical cure.",Journal of perioperative practice,23767268,2013

Efficacy and tolerability of Day 2 manipulation and local anaesthesia after collagenase injection in patients with Dupuytren's contracture.,"In clinical trials, treating Dupuytren's contracture with collagenase injection involves manipulation the day after injection, without local anaesthesia. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of manipulation 2 days after injection with local anaesthesia. Forty-five patients received 50 injections into cords contracting metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints; follow-up visits were at 3 and 14 weeks. For the metacarpophalangeal joints there were &gt;90% reduction in contracture at both visits. The proximal interphalangeal joints that improved spontaneously after metacarpophalangeal injection or received direct injections showed 51-55% reduction in contracture. Changes in scores on the Patient Evaluation Measure suggest that patients perceived improvements in their hand function was good and they were satisfied with the procedure. Collagenase and local anaesthesia injections were well tolerated; adverse events were localized to the injection site and were mild and transient in nature. These findings provide another viable option for practising surgeons and may help with the logistics of patient care. ","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",23719171,2013
The impact of Dupuytren disease on patient activity and quality of life.,"PURPOSE: To explore the impact of Dupuytren disease (DD) from the patients' perspective.METHODS: Audio-recorded interviews were conducted for patients with Dupuytren disease (DD) attending outpatient clinics. The interviews were transcribed and subjected to content analysis. This analysis highlighted key impact areas and common themes in individuals' personal experiences. These were then allocated to categories specified by the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (impairments and activity limitations) and the needs-based model of quality of life (QoL).RESULTS: Qualitative unstructured interviews were conducted with 34 patients (74% men; age, 41-80 y; mean [SD], 64 [13] y). The sample had a wide range of severity and duration of DD (range, 0.5-40; mean [SD], 13 [10] y). Nine hundred fifty-three statements relating to the impact of DD were identified from the interview transcripts. These statements fell into 2 major categories of impact: activity limitations (10 themes including problems with dressing, gripping, and personal care) and QoL (6 need categories: physiological, safety and security, social, affection, esteem, and cognitive needs).CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the interviews suggest that DD affects both performance of activities and QoL. To determine accurately the effectiveness of DD interventions from the patients' perspective, it is important to determine their impacts on both activity limitations and QoL. We intend to develop valid, reproducible, and responsive DD-specific scales for this purpose.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study identifies key issues specific to DD that influence patients' functioning and QoL. The information reported will form the basis of DD-specific patient-reported outcomes measures for use in clinical practice and evaluations of interventions.",The Journal of hand surgery,23707018,2013

Isometric contraction of Dupuytren's myofibroblasts is inhibited by blocking intercellular junctions.,"Myofibroblasts (MFs) are responsible for both physiological wound and scar contraction. However, it is not known whether these cells act individually to contract the surrounding matrix or whether they behave in a coordinated manner. Therefore, we studied intercellular junctions of primary human MFs derived from patients with Dupuytren's disease, a fibrotic disorder of the dermis and subdermal tissues of the palm. The cells were maintained in anchored three-dimensional collagen lattices to closely mimic conditions in vivo. We found that selective blockade of adherens, mechanosensitive, or gap junctions effectively inhibited contraction of the collagen matrices and downregulated the MF phenotype. Our data indicate that MFs in part function as a coordinated cellular syncytium, and disruption of intercellular communication may provide a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by an overabundance of these contractile cells.

IGF-II and IGFBP-6 regulate cellular contractility and proliferation in Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common and heritable fibrosis of the palmar fascia that typically manifests as permanent finger contractures. The molecular interactions that induce the development of hyper-contractile fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, in DD are poorly understood. We have identified IGF2 and IGFBP6, encoding insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-6 respectively, as reciprocally dysregulated genes and proteins in primary cells derived from contracture tissues (DD cells). Recombinant IGFBP-6 inhibited the proliferation of DD cells, patient-matched control (PF) cells and normal palmar fascia (CT) cells. Co-treatments with IGF-II, a high affinity IGFBP-6 ligand, were unable to rescue these effects. A non-IGF-II binding analog of IGFBP-6 also inhibited cellular proliferation, implicating IGF-II-independent roles for IGFBP-6 in this process. IGF-II enhanced the proliferation of CT cells, but not DD or PF cells, and significantly enhanced DD and PF cell contractility in stressed collagen lattices. While IGFBP-6 treatment did not affect cellular contractility, it abrogated the IGF-II-induced contractility of DD and PF cells in stressed collagen lattices. IGF-II also significantly increased the contraction of DD cells in relaxed lattices, however this effect was not evident in relaxed collagen lattices containing PF cells. The disparate effects of IGF-II on DD and PF cells in relaxed and stressed contraction models suggest that IGF-II can enhance lattice contractility through more than one mechanism. This is the first report to implicate IGFBP-6 as a suppressor of cellular proliferation and IGF-II as an inducer of cellular contractility in this connective tissue disease.

Optimal functional outcome measures for assessing treatment for Dupuytren's disease: a systematic review and recommendations for future practice.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease of the hand is a common condition affecting the palmar fascia, resulting in progressive flexion deformities of the digits and hence limitation of hand function. The optimal treatment remains unclear as outcomes studies have used a variety of measures for assessment.METHODS: A literature search was performed for all publications describing surgical treatment, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy or collagenase injection for primary or recurrent Dupuytren's disease where outcomes had been monitored using functional measures.RESULTS: Ninety-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies reported outcomes using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) ranging from validated questionnaires to self-reported measures for return to work and self-rated disability. The Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was the most utilised patient-reported function measure (n=11). Patient satisfaction was reported by eighteen studies but no single method was used consistently. Range of movement was the most frequent physical measure and was reported in all 91 studies. However, the methods of measurement and reporting varied, with seventeen different techniques being used. Other physical measures included grip and pinch strength and sensibility, again with variations in measurement protocols. The mean follow-up time ranged from 2 weeks to 17 years.CONCLUSIONS: There is little consistency in the reporting of outcomes for interventions in patients with Dupuytren's disease, making it impossible to compare the efficacy of different treatment modalities. Although there are limitations to the existing generic patient reported outcomes measures, a combination of these together with a disease-specific questionnaire, and physical measures of active and passive individual joint Range of movement (ROM), grip and sensibility using standardised protocols should be used for future outcomes studies. As Dupuytren's disease tends to recur following treatment as well as extend to involve other areas of the hand, follow-up times should be standardised and designed to capture both short and long term outcomes.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,23575442,2013
"Genome-wide analysis using exon arrays demonstrates an important role for expression of extra-cellular matrix, fibrotic control and tissue remodelling genes in Dupuytren's disease.","Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a classic example of pathological fibrosis which results in a debilitating disorder affecting a large sector of the human population. It is characterized by excessive local proliferation of fibroblasts and over-production of collagen and other components of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the palmar fascia. The fibrosis progressively results in contracture of elements between the palmar fascia and skin causing flexion deformity or clawing of the fingers and a severe reduction in hand function. While much is known about the pathogenesis and surgical treatment of DD, little is known about the factors that cause its onset and progression, despite many years of research. Gene expression patterns in DD patients now offers the potential to identify genes that direct the pathogenesis of DD. In this study we used primary cultures of fibroblasts derived from excisional biopsies of fibrotic tissue from DD patients to compare the gene expression profiles on a genome-wide basis with normal control fibroblasts. Our investigations have identified genes that may be involved with DD pathogenesis including some which are directly relevant to fibrosis. In particular, these include significantly reduced expression levels of three matrix metallopeptidases (MMP1, MMP3, MMP16), follistatin, and STAT1, and significantly increased expression levels of fibroblast growth factors (FGF9, FGF11), a number of collagen genes and other ECM genes in DD patient samples. Many of these gene products are known to be involved in fibrosis, tumour formation and in the normal processes of tissue remodelling. In addition, alternative splicing was identified in some DD associated genes. These highly sensitive genomic investigations provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that may underpin the development and progression of DD.",PloS one,23554969,2013
Analysis of efficacy and safety of treatment with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum among subgroups of patients with Dupuytren contracture.,"Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection is a nonoperative treatment of hand contractures from Dupuytren disease. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of CCH in several subgroups of patients with increased surgical risk.Data were pooled from 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials. This analysis included 271 patients with metacarpophalangeal (n = 167) or proximal interphalangeal (n = 104) joint contractures greater than or equal to 20 degrees treated with CCH (0.58 mg collagenase per injection). Subgroups included age, sex, and diabetes status. End points included rate of clinical success (reduction in contracture to 0-5 degrees of normal) and percentage of adverse events.There was no significant difference in clinical success by age, diabetes status, or sex with 63% reaching the end point. There was no difference in adverse events among the subgroups, with peripheral edema, contusion, and injection-site hemorrhage being most common.High-risk subgroups do not demonstrate differences in efficacy or safety with CCH treatment of Dupuytren-related contractures.

Budget impact analysis in Spanish patients with Dupuytren's contracture: fasciectomy vs. collagenase Clostridium histolyticum.,"The aim of this study was to estimate the budget impact of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) vs. fasciectomy (FSC) surgery for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease (DD) in Spain. A cost minimization analysis was adopted (effectiveness was assumed to be equivalent for both techniques). DD related costs were considered. CCH costs (including drug, administration and visits) were obtained from clinical trials and a real-life study. FSC costs (including type of admission, visits, operating room, re-admissions, tests, drugs and rehabilitation costs) were collected through a retrospective, observational, local study. Unit costs were obtained from local database systems (e-SALUD and BOT). Results were presented from the NHS perspective for the next 3 years. We assumed that there were 5100 fasciectomies per year (with a 5% annual increase) and that 20%, 30% and 40% of them will annually utilize CCH. In addition, a 10%, 15% and 20% of untreated diagnosed patients were expected to receive CCH. All the data were validated through an expert panel. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the main variables. The average FSC cost was €2250 (72% inpatients), €1703 for outpatients and €2467 for inpatients. The average CCH cost was €1220 (1.5 vial/injection and four visits) and could drop to €898 (1.1 vial/injections and three visits). The accumulated 3years budget impact analysis (BIA) was 45,971€ (K€-2993(1); 3870).

As predicted, early recurrence rate was the main issue with a rate of 28% at the time of the questionnaire.CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is a safe and efficient procedure in treating patients with early Dupuytren or those who would not potentially achieve good results with more aggressive surgical intervention.",Annals of plastic surgery,23503435,2013
Cost comparison of open fasciectomy versus percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for treatment of Dupuytren contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Many surgical options exist for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture. Little has been written regarding their financial implications. The purpose of this study was to compare the immediate direct costs of open fasciectomy to percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (NA) for the surgical treatment of Dupuytren contracture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed comparing patients treated with open fasciectomy (group 1) to patients treated with percutaneous NA (group 2) for the treatment of Dupuytren disease from 2008 to 2010. Financial and medical records were reviewed. Direct cost of treatment was calculated from hospital billing records, including surgical, anesthesia, and facility fees. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t test.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received open segmental palmar and/or digital fasciectomy (group 1). Average preoperative metacarpophalangeal joint flexion contracture was 30 degrees, and proximal interphalangeal joint flexion contracture was 42 degrees. Group 2 consisted of 24 patients. Average preoperative metacarpophalangeal flexion contracture was 31 degrees, and proximal interphalangeal flexion contracture was 27 degrees. Mean cost for group 1 was $11,240 and mean cost for group 2 was $4657 (P &lt; 0.0001). Immediate postoperative contracture correction was similar between both. Two complications occurred in group 1 (wound dehiscence and nerve injury); no complications in group 2.CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous NA is associated with decreased direct costs in the short-term compared to traditional open fasciectomy with comparable deformity correction.",Annals of plastic surgery,23486126,2013
The effect of a therapy protocol for increasing correction of severely contracted proximal interphalangeal joints caused by dupuytren disease and treated with collagenase injection.,"PURPOSE: To determine the effect of a specific orthotic intervention and therapy protocol on proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures of greater than 40° caused by Dupuytren disease and treated with collagenase injections.METHODS: All patients with PIP joints contracted at least 40° by Dupuytren disease were prospectively invited to participate in the study. Following standard collagenase injection and cord rupture by a hand surgeon, a certified hand therapist evaluated and treated each patient based on a defined treatment protocol that consisted of orthotic intervention to address residual PIP joint contracture. In addition, exercises were initiated emphasizing reverse blocking for PIP joint extension and distal interphalangeal joint flexion exercises with the PIP joint held in extension to lengthen a frequently shortened oblique retinacular ligament. Patients were assessed before injection, immediately after injection, and 1 and 4 weeks later. There were 22 fingers in 21 patients. The mean age at treatment was 63 years (range, 37-80 y).RESULTS: The mean baseline passive PIP joint contracture was 56° (range, 40° to 80°). At cord rupture, the mean PIP joint contracture became 22° (range, 0° to 55°). One week after cord rupture and therapy, the contracture decreased further to a mean of 12° (range, 0° to 36°). By 4 weeks, the mean contracture was 7° (range, 0° to 35°). The differences in PIP joint contracture were statistically significant at all time points except when comparing the means at 1 week and 4 weeks. The results represent an 88% improvement of the PIP joint contracture.CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, it appears that severe PIP joint contractures benefit from specific, postinjection orthotic intervention and targeted exercises.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,23474162,2013
[Utilization of health care resources and cost associated to fasciectomy in Dupuytren's disease in Spain].,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the healthcare resource utilization and their associated costs secondary to fasciectomy of Dupuytren s disease (DD) treated under usual medical practice in Spain.METHODS: This multicenter, observational, retrospective cohort study, extracted data through the revision of medical records of three tertiary public hospitals. Each center should recruit 40 patients operated for DD, as principal diagnose of Minimum Data Set, in which the surgical procedure conducted was fasciectomy, during 2007-2009. To collect all the resources used during surgery, a specific chart form was designed. Demographic (age, gender, occupational status), clinical (stage of contracture and comorbilities) and healthcare utilization (hospitalizations, medical visits, tests, drugs) data were collected under medical routine. Comparisons between stage of contracture grouped (I: stage N, 1 &amp; 2; II: stage 3 &amp; 4) and centers were made.RESULTS: A total of 123 subjects (52% group I; 86.2% men; 35.8% active workers) were identified. 81.3% of patients presented at least one comorbidity, being hypertension the most frequent. 28.4% of patients were operated in ambulatory surgery and 71.6% hospitalized. All the patients had follow-up visits after surgery, 27% needed physical therapy, 88% performed preoperative tests and 8% visit the emergency room after surgery. Healthcare mean (SD) costs were as follows: fasciectomy €1,074 (0); hospitalizations €978 (743); ambulatory €186 (10); follow-up visits €260 (173); emergency rooms €13 (53); tests €78(43); drugs €7 (9); physical therapy €46 (134). Mean total costs were €2,250 (839). There were no significant differences between study groups grouped by stage of contracture. However, the center and the severity of the CD seem explanatory variables of cost, p&lt;0.05.CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare resources utilization for surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease may cost €2,250 (839) per fasciectomy treated under usual medical practice.",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,23461499,2013
Unraveling the signaling pathways promoting fibrosis in Dupuytren's disease reveals TNF as a therapeutic target.,"Dupuytren's disease is a very common progressive fibrosis of the palm leading to flexion deformities of the digits that impair hand function. The cell responsible for development of the disease is the myofibroblast. There is currently no treatment for early disease or for preventing recurrence following surgical excision of affected tissue in advanced disease. Therefore, we sought to unravel the signaling pathways leading to the development of myofibroblasts in Dupuytren's disease. We characterized the cells present in Dupuytren's tissue and found significant numbers of immune cells, including classically activated macrophages. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines were also detected in tissue from Dupuytren's patients. We compared the effects of these cytokines on contraction and profibrotic signaling pathways in fibroblasts from the palmar and nonpalmar dermis of Dupuytren's patients and palmar fibroblasts from non-Dupuytren's patients. Exogenous addition of TNF, but not other cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1β, promoted differentiation into specifically of palmar dermal fibroblasts from Dupuytren's patients in to myofibroblasts. We also demonstrated that TNF acts via the Wnt signaling pathway to drive contraction and profibrotic signaling in these cells. Finally, we examined the effects of targeted cytokine inhibition. Neutralizing antibodies to TNF inhibited the contractile activity of myofibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's patients, reduced their expression of α-smooth muscle actin, and mediated disassembly of the contractile apparatus. Therefore, we showed that localized inflammation in Dupuytren's disease contributes to the development and progression of this fibroproliferative disorder and identified TNF as a therapeutic target to down-regulate myofibroblast differentiation and activity.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,23431165,2013
Surgical management of Dupuytren's contracture in Europe: regional analysis of a surgeon survey and patient chart review.,"AIM: We explored regional variations in the surgical management of patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) in 12 European countries using a surgeon survey and patient chart review.METHODS: Twelve countries participated: Denmark, Finland, Sweden (Nordic region); Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland (East); France, Germany, the Netherlands, UK (West); Italy, Spain (Mediterranean). For the survey, a random sample of orthopaedic/plastic surgeons (n = 687) with 3-30 years' experience was asked about DC procedures performed during the previous 12 months. For the chart review (n = 3357), information from up to five consecutive patients was extracted. Descriptive statistics are reported.RESULTS: Ninety-five per cent of all surgeons used fasciectomy for DC, followed by fasciotomy (70%), dermofasciectomy (38%) and percutaneous needle fasciotomy (35%). Most surgeons were satisfied with fasciectomy over other procedures. Recommended time away from work and duration of physical therapy increased with the invasiveness of the procedure. The intra-operative complication rate was 4.0%; the postoperative complication rate was 34%. Overall, ≥ 97% of the procedures were rated by surgeons as having a positive outcome. Across all regions, 54% of patients had no nodules or contracture after the procedures. Only 2% of patients required retreatment within the first year of surgery. Important inter- and intraregional differences in these aspects of patient management are described.CONCLUSIONS: Understanding current regional treatment patterns and their relationships to country-specific health systems may facilitate earlier identification of, and intervention for, DD and help to optimise the overall treatment for patients with this chronic condition.",International journal of clinical practice,23409695,2013
"Dupuytren's disease presentation, referral pathways and resource utilisation in Europe: regional analysis of a surgeon survey and patient chart review.","AIM: We explored the management of Dupuytren's disease (DD) using a surgeon survey and patient chart review.METHODS: Twelve countries participated: Denmark, Finland, Sweden (Nordic region); Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland (East); France, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (West); Italy, Spain (Mediterranean). A random sample of orthopaedic/plastic surgeons (N = 687) with 3-30 years' experience was asked about Dupuytren's contracture procedures performed during the previous 12 months. Information ≤ 5 consecutive patients per surgeon was extracted from patient charts (N = 3357).RESULTS: Overall, 84% of participants were orthopaedic surgeons; 56% of surgeons were hand specialists. Deciding factors for fasciectomy and dermofasciectomy were consistent across regions: metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal contracture &gt; 45°, recurrent contracture, and high expectations for success. Deciding factors for percutaneous needle fasciotomy were less consistent across regions, but the leading factor was MP flexion &lt; 20°. Overall, 49% of diagnoses and 55% of referrals were made by a general practitioner (GP), with regional variation: 31-77% for GP diagnoses and 36-81% for GP referrals. There were also differences in admission status (e.g. 9% of Nordic patients and 80% of Eastern patients were treated as inpatients). Most patients were treated in public hospitals and most procedures were covered by public health insurance.CONCLUSIONS: We found regional variations in surgical practice, patient characteristics and referral patterns. Understanding current diagnosis and treatment patterns, in relation to regional differences in health economics, may improve physicians' diagnosis of DD and guide patients towards appropriate, customised management plans.",International journal of clinical practice,23409694,2013
[Concomitance of Ledderhose's disease with Dupuytren's contracture. Own experience].,INTRODUCTION: Ledderhose's disease is a rare fibromatosis affecting plantar aponeurosis. Clinical picture and risk factors resemble the ones found in much more common cases of Dupuytren's disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of 101 patients with Dupuytren's disease qualified for surgical treatment constituted material for the study. Within that group incidence of Ledderhose's disease was assessed on the basis of clinical and ultrasound examination. Estimation of the presence of risk factors common for both forms of fibromatosis was also evaluated.RESULTS: Ledderhose's disease was found in 15 patients (14.85%) suffering from Dupuytren's contracture. Bilateral Ledderhose's disease was found in 10 of them. Established risk factors were similar to the ones found in Dupuytren's disease--tobacco and alcohol dominated. Indications for the surgical treatment were limited to the symptomatic cases of the disease. Two feet in 4 patients were operated on. Surgical technique was presented in broad outline. Pain relief on walking and normalization of feet pressure distribution were achieved in all cases.,Przeglad lekarski,23401985,2013
Skin graft loss resulting from collagenase clostridium histolyticum treatment of Dupuytren contracture: case report and review of the literature.,"Treatment of Dupuytren disease with collagenase clostridium histolyticum is increasingly used among hand surgeons. Although it is generally safe and efficacious, complications related to enzymatic fasciotomy occur. Postapproval surveillance and communication among hand surgeons continues to refine the indications, contraindications, and complications recognized in the treatment of Dupuytren disease with enzymatic therapy. Major treatment-related adverse events previously reported include flexor tendon rupture and complex regional pain syndrome. We report a patient who experienced total loss of a well-established volar ring finger skin graft following collagenase injection and propose a potential mechanism of vulnerability. This case may illustrate the susceptibility of type I collagen, which is uniformly present in a healed skin graft bed, to degradation with collagenase. We propose a cautious approach when considering treatment of a Dupuytren cord with collagenase in the presence of an overlying skin graft, regardless of the age of the graft.",The Journal of hand surgery,23391354,2013
Association of Morbus Ledderhose with Dupuytren's contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Fibromatous nodules in the sole of the foot are often called Ledderhose disease. It is a benign nodular formation in the plantar aponeurosis, typically at the distal medial border. A lump forms and it can be a few centimeters in diameter. It is frequently seen as an isolated disease, but a relationship to Dupuytren's has been noted in some patients.METHODS: The study was a part of a large cohort study, the Reykjavík study. Men with Dupuytren's disease (n = 122) were invited to follow-up 18 years after the initial observation. An equal number of controls, matched for age and smoking habits, were also invited. A total of 92 Dupuytren's patients and 101 control subjects attended for follow-up and were examined for plantar nodules. Statistical evaluation was carried out using chi-square test and presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).RESULTS: Ledderhose disease was identified in 14 of the 92 (15.2%) men with Dupuytren's disease, while it was only in 4 of the 101 (3.9%) matched controls (OR = 4.35, 95% CI, 1.3-16.7, P &lt; 0.01). Men operated for Dupuytren's disease or with finger contractures were more likely to have plantar nodules than those with only nodules or strings in the palms (OR = 6.1, 95% CI, 1.8-27.1, P &lt; 0.001). The plantar involvement was related to family history of Dupuytren's disease (OR = 3.1, 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: Men with manifestations of finger contractures or who need surgery for Dupuytren's disease are more likely to also develop plantar fibromas.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative series.",Foot &amp; ankle international,23386754,2013
[Dupuytren disease].,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren disease (DD) is a connective tissue disorder that consists in fibromatosis of the palmar and digital fascia (in form of nodules or flanges) that leads to the development of flexion contractures of the palm and fingers. The little and ring finger are particularly affected. The disease can limit hand function, reducing the quality of life. The disease can have a traumatic origin and is also associated with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, dyslipidemia, epilepsy and AIDS, among others. However, none of these conditions can fully explain the genesis of DD. A hereditary component is described in 40% of patients and is attributed to an autosomal dominant gene of variable penetrance, probably related to collagen synthesis. However there are also spontaneous and recessive inheritance cases. The diagnosis is clinical and based on physical examination. Treatment ranges from observation or use of injectable collagenase to the surgical option in cases with significant functional limitations.",Revista medica de Chile,23354642,2013
"Recognition, diagnosis and referral of patients with Dupuytren's disease: a review of current concepts for general practitioners in Europe.","BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fairly prevalent yet under-recognised disorder of the palmar fascia, resulting in fixed-flexion contractures of joints in the hand. Numerous population-based studies have been conducted in countries around the world, and published prevalence estimates vary widely. Nevertheless, most studies have shown that the prevalence of DD increases with age. Because the global population is aging, the prevalence of DD will also continue to increase.SCOPE: Patients with DD typically present to a variety of physicians, generalists and specialists alike. Thus, it is critical that providers have clear guidance on the early recognition of signs and symptoms, comprehensive evaluation of potential risk factors, differential diagnosis and when to refer a patient for treatment. Treatment options range from minimally invasive injections with collagenase to surgery.FINDINGS: Results from a large-scale study of the surgical management of DD in Europe indicate that most DD diagnoses and referrals are made by general practitioners, but there is much inter-country variation. Different patient- and physician-based factors affect diagnosis rates and referral pathways. Different healthcare systems and regulations are also influential. A simple management algorithm is provided herein and explained.CONCLUSION: It is important for generalists to understand the natural history of DD and the potential benefits of early referral and treatment. General practitioners should diagnose and/or refer patients with DD to a specialist as early as possible to optimise disease management and treatment outcomes.",Current medical research and opinion,23320611,2013
Common variants of the ALDH2 and DHDH genes and the risk of Dupuytren's disease.,"The object of this study was the investigation of four common variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the aldehyde dehydrogenase H2 gene and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene and their association with the occurrence of Dupuytren's disease. DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral blood of 300 consecutive patients. The control group comprised 300 healthy adults who were age matched with the Dupuytren's patients. All four common variants were analysed using TaqMan® genotyping assays and sequencing. The differences in the frequencies of variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms in patients and the control group were statistically tested. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of the variants of the aldehyde dehydrogenase H2 and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase genes between the groups. Likewise, no significant differences were found in the frequencies of the variants of the genes between men and women. We noted a statistically significantly higher prevalence of the variants of the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene (rs2270941 and rs11666105) in the group with a positive familial history of Dupuytren's disease, in comparison with the group with a negative familial history.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",23303836,2013
Increased CCT-eta expression is a marker of latent and active disease and a modulator of fibroblast contractility in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by a scar-like contracture that develops in the palm and/or digits. We have previously reported that the eta subunit of the chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide (CCT-eta) is increased in fibrotic wound healing, and is essential for the accumulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in fibroblasts. The purpose of this study was to determine if CCT-eta is similarly implicated in the aberrant fibrosis seen in DC and to investigate the role of CCT-eta in the behavior of myo/fibroblasts in DC. Fibroblasts were obtained from DC-affected palmar fascia, from adjacent phenotypically normal palmar fascia in the same DC patients (PF), and from non-DC palmar fascial tissues in patients undergoing carpal tunnel (CT) release. Inherent contractility in these three populations was examined using fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCLs) and by cell traction force microscopy. Expression of CCT-eta and α-SMA protein was determined by Western blot. The effect of CCT-eta inhibition on the contractility of DC cells was determined by deploying an siRNA versus CCT-eta. DC cells were significantly more contractile than both matching palmar fascial (PF) cells and CT cells in both assays, with PF cells demonstrating an intermediate contractility in the FPCL assay. Whereas α-SMA protein was significantly increased only in DC cells compared to PF and CT cells, CCT-eta protein was significantly increased in both PF and DC cells compared to CT cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of CCT-eta inhibited the accumulation of both CCT-eta and α-SMA protein in DC cells, and also significantly decreased the contractility of treated DC cells. These observations suggest that increased expression of CCT-eta appears to be a marker for latent and active disease in these patients and to be essential for the increased contractility exhibited by these fibroblasts.",Cell stress &amp; chaperones,23292503,2013
Contribution of kinesophobia and catastrophic thinking to upper-extremity-specific disability.,"BACKGROUND: Upper-extremity-specific disability correlates with mood and coping strategies. The aim of this study was to determine if two psychological factors, kinesiophobia (fear of movement) and perceived partner support, contribute significantly to variation in upper-extremity-specific disability in a model that included factors known to contribute to variation such as depression, pain anxiety, and catastrophic thinking.METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study of 319 patients who each had one of the following conditions: trigger finger (n = 94), carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 29), trapeziometacarpal arthrosis (n = 33), Dupuytren contracture (n = 31), de Quervain syndrome (n = 28), wrist ganglion cyst (n = 32), lateral epicondylosis (n = 41), and a fracture of the distal part of the radius treated nonoperatively six weeks previously (n = 31). Each patient completed the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and questionnaires measuring symptoms of depression, pain anxiety, catastrophic thinking, kinesiophobia, and perceived level of support from a partner or significant other. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to determine significant independent predictors of the DASH score.RESULTS: Men had significantly lower (better) DASH scores than women (21 versus 31; p &lt; 0.01). DASH scores also differed significantly by diagnosis (p &lt; 0.01), marital status (p = 0.047), and employment status (p &lt; 0.01). The DASH score correlated significantly with depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.01), catastrophic thinking (p &lt; 0.01), kinesiophobia (p &lt; 0.01), and pain anxiety (p &lt; 0.01) but not with perceived partner support. The best multivariable model of factors associated with greater arm-specific disability (according to the DASH score) included sex, diagnosis, employment status, catastrophic thinking, and kinesiophobia and accounted for 55% of the variation.CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, kinesiophobia and catastrophic thinking were the most important predictors of upper-extremity-specific disability in a model that accounted for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pathophysiology (diagnosis) and explained more than half of the variation in disability. Perceived partner support was not a significant factor. The consistent and predominant role of several modifiable psychological factors in disability suggests that patients may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes mindset and coping strategies.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

[A coexistence of the Dupuytren's disease and malignant neoplasms: a review].,"Dupuytren's disease is classified as a benign superficial fibromatosis, in which excessive proliferation of myofibroblats and formation of nodules and chords occurs, followed by development of finger contractures. The similarities between Dupuytren's disease and neoplasms were shown at molecular and clinical grounds. The objective of the study was to review of the literature investigating possible relationship between occurrence of Dupuytren's disease and malignancies. Review of the few available papers shows (1) statistically significantly increased malignant neoplasm mortality among men with advanced Dupuytren's disease, comparing to reference population and men with early stage of the disease, (2) statistically significantly increased malignant neoplasm morbidity, mainly related to smoking and alcohol consumption among patients (men and women) operated on for Dupuytren's disease and (3) increased sarcoma of the bone and soft tissue morbidity in patients 5 years after operation for Dupuytren's disease. Some genetical studies show also altered expression of the dehydrogenases ALDH2 and DHDH genes in patients with Dupuytren's disease and with digestive tract malignancies related to alcohol abuse.",Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis,24734329,2013

Rheumatic conditions in patients with diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic systemic disease with a wide range of complications, including complications in the musculoskeletal system. DM is a common disease in nearly all countries and continues to increase in numbers and significance. Approximately 90 % of patients have type 2 DM which is caused by resistance to insulin. Type 1 DM results from an absolute deficiency of insulin due to an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells within the pancreas. Diabetic patients suffer from diverse rheumatic conditions that affect their life quality. This article reviews the rheumatic conditions that are associated with DM and the pathophysiologic relationships that might link these conditions; it also summarizes recent advances in the field of diabetes and rheumatic conditions. The rheumatic conditions that are discussed in this review include limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tenosynovitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, adhesive capsulitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, neuropathic osteoarthropathy, diabetic muscle infarction, crystal induced arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.",Clinical rheumatology,23247555,2012

Efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection for Dupuytren contracture: short-term results from 2 open-label studies.,"PURPOSE: The JOINT I (United States) and JOINT II (Australia and Europe) studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: Both studies used identical open-label protocols. Patients with fixed-flexion contractures of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) (20° to 100°) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints (20° to 80°) could receive up to three 0.58-mg CCH injections per cord (up to 5 total injections per patient). We performed standardized finger extension procedures to disrupt injected cords the next day, with follow-up 1, 2, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The primary end point (clinical success) was reduction in contracture to within 0° to 5° of full extension 30 days after the last injection. Clinical improvement was defined as 50% or more reduction from baseline contracture.RESULTS: Dupuytren cords affecting 879 joints (531 MCP and 348 PIP) in 587 patients were administered CCH injections at 14 U.S. and 20 Australian/European sites, with similar outcomes in both studies. Clinical success was achieved in 497 (57%) of treated joints using 1.2 ± 0.5 (mean ± SD) CCH injections per cord. More MCP than PIP joints achieved clinical success (70% and 37%, respectively) or clinical improvement (89% and 58%, respectively). Less severely contracted joints responded better than those more severely contracted. Mean change in contracture was 55° for MCP joints and 25° for PIP joints. With average contracture reductions of 73% and improvements in range of motion by 30°, most patients (92%) were &quot;very satisfied&quot; (71%) or &quot;quite satisfied&quot; (21%) with treatment. Physicians rated change from baseline as &quot;very much improved&quot; (47%) or &quot;much improved&quot; (35%). The CCH injections were well tolerated, causing no tendon ruptures or systemic reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was an effective, minimally invasive option for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture of a broad range of severities. Most treated joints (625 of 879) required a single injection. Treatment earlier in the course of disease provided improved outcomes.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,23218556,2012
Ultrasonographic evaluation of displaced neurovascular bundle in Dupuytren disease.,"PURPOSE: Neurovascular injury is a serious complication after surgery for Dupuytren disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the cord and the neurovascular bundle ultrasonographically.METHODS: We included 22 healthy volunteers and 14 Dupuytren disease patients (25 fingers) in this study. We evaluated the cord and the digital artery with high-resolution ultrasound. We first investigated the effect of the angle of metacarpophalangeal joint on the position of the radial and ulnar digital arteries in volunteers without evidence of Dupuytren disease. We compared 3 parameters of the radial and ulnar digital arteries, including differences in depth, differences in lateral shift, and the shape of the cross-section of the artery, between volunteers and patients with Dupuytren disease.RESULTS: None of these parameters changed with flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint of 0°, 30°, and 60°. Digital arteries and cords could be identified ultrasonographically in all patients, and we confirmed ultrasonographic findings by operative findings in 13 fingers. We classified the fingers into 3 subgroups based on the ultrasonographic findings: type A (n = 13), in which the cord was above the artery; type B (n = 5), in which the cord was below the artery; and type C (n = 7), in which the cord was located between the radial and ulnar digital arteries. Types A, B, and C corresponded to natatory cord/abductor digiti minimi cord, spiral cord, and central cord, respectively. Comparisons among volunteers and patient subgroups showed that the difference in depth in type B patients was significantly larger than that of the other groups. When we set the cutoff point of the difference in depth to 3 mm, sensitivity and specificity to detect the spiral cord were 80% and 76%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the neurovascular bundle and the type of Dupuytren disease cord can be evaluated by high-resolution ultrasound.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.",The Journal of hand surgery,23218555,2012
Dupuytren contracture recurrence following treatment with collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CORDLESS study): 3-year data.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) after the third year of a 5-year nontreatment follow-up study, Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren Long-Term Evaluation of Safety Study.METHODS: This study enrolled Dupuytren contracture patients from 5 previous clinical studies. Beginning 2 years after their first CCH injection, we re-evaluated patients annually for joint contracture and safety. Recurrence in a previously successfully treated joint (success = 0° to 5° contracture after CCH administration) was defined as 20° or greater worsening in contracture in the presence of a palpable cord or medical/surgical intervention to correct new or worsening contracture. We assessed partially corrected joints (joints reduced 20° or more from baseline contracture but not to 0° to 5°) for nondurable response, also defined as 20° or greater worsening of contracture or medical/surgical intervention.RESULTS: Of 1,080 CCH-treated joints (648 metacarpophalangeal [MCP]; 432 proximal interphalangeal [PIP]; n = 643 patients), 623 (451 MCP, 172 PIP) had achieved 0° to 5° contracture in the original study. Of these joints, 35% (217 of 623) recurred (MCP 27%; PIP 56%). Of these recurrences, an intervention was performed in 7%. Of the 1,080 CCH-treated joints, 301 were partially corrected in the original study. Of these, 50% (150 of 301; MCP: 38% [57 of 152]; PIP: 62% [93 of 149]) had nondurable response. We identified no new long-term or serious adverse events attributed to CCH during follow-up. Anti-clostridial type I collagenase and/or anti-clostridial type II collagenase antibodies were reported for 96% or more of patients who received 2 or more CCH injections and 82% who received 1 injection.CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence rate, which is comparable to other standard treatments, and the absence of long-term adverse events 3 years after initial treatment indicate that CCH is an effective and safe treatment for Dupuytren contracture. Most successfully treated joints had a contracture well below the threshold for surgical intervention 3 years after treatment. Recurrence rates among successfully treated joints were lower than nondurable response rates among partially corrected joints.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,23200951,2012
Efficacy of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin in wound healing:  a randomized controlled clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Application of platelet concentrates to wounds could speed healing. Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin, a relatively recent development, stands out from the other preparations. This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial studied the rate of healing of postoperative hand wounds after a single application of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin.METHODS: Eligible patients were healthy individuals older than 18 years who had been scheduled for elective McCash (open palm) surgery for Dupuytren disease at the Plastic and Hand Surgery Department of Nice's University Hospital between August of 2007 and February of 2010. The control group received the reference care of petroleum jelly mesh (Vaselitulle), and test patients had leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin applied. The primary endpoint was healing delay measured in postoperative days. Secondary endpoints included pain, bleeding, and wound exudate. The trial was carried out as a single-blind trial.RESULTS: Among the 68 randomized patients, 33 patients in the leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin group and 31 in the Vaselitulle group were analyzed. Primary endpoint analysis showed a median healing delay of 24 days (interquartile range, 18 to 28 days) for the fibrin group and 29 days (interquartile range, 26 to 35 days) for the Vaselitulle group (p = 0.014, log-rank test). Postoperative pain assessment, bleeding, and exudate were always lower for the fibrin group, but not significantly so.CONCLUSION: The authors trial demonstrates that a single leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin application on fresh postoperative hand wounds shows a median improvement of 5 days in comparison with the standard treatment.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,23190833,2012
Minimally invasive partial fasciectomy for Dupuytren contractures.,"Treatment options for the Dupuytren contractures vary from percutaneous needle aponeurotomy, open fasciotomy or fasciectomy, dermofasciectomy, and more recently, injectable collagenase. Although utilization of injectable collagenase avoids a formal surgical procedure, not all patients are eligible and some patients do not feel comfortable with an enzyme injection or the associated risks, which may include hematoma, wound dehiscence, or tendon rupture. This study describes the technique and early results of partial fasciectomy through a mini-incision approach as an additional treatment option for Dupuytren contractures. We found that this procedure results in contracture correction with a low rate of complications and thus provides the surgeon with an alternative treatment option to offer patients.",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,23160547,2012
The consequences of different definitions for recurrence of Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Recurrence rates are important in the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment for Dupuytren's disease (DD). In the literature, recurrence rates vary between 0% and 100%. The definition of recurrence of DD after treatment is inconsistently used. The aim of this study is to review all definitions of recurrence after treatment of DD and to evaluate the impact of using these definitions on a single cohort of patients treated for DD.METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase to identify studies. Titles and abstracts were analysed to collect all articles that described recurrence rates or definitions of recurrence. Two independent reviewers selected relevant studies and extracted data. The different definitions of recurrence were applied on our data set of 66 patients.RESULTS: Of the 113 articles reporting recurrent rates of DD, 56 (49%) presented a definition of recurrence. We could categorise the definitions into three groups. By applying the different definition on our data set of a randomised controlled trial, the recurrence rates ranged from 2% to 86%.CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, different definitions of recurrence of DD are used and many authors failed to define recurrence. This study shows that the wide range of reported recurrence rates may largely be contributed by inconsistency in recurrence definitions. As a result, it is difficult or even impossible to compare recurrence rates between different treatments reported in the literature. The study indicates that consensus on a recurrence definition is needed.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",23137947,2012
Acellular dermal matrices in hand reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND: The goal of this article is to review the current literature on the use of acellular dermal matrix in forearm, wrist, and hand reconstruction.METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge. Articles were categorized as acellular dermal matrix used in soft-tissue repair and in ligament reconstruction. Search terms included &quot;acellular dermal matrix,&quot; &quot;biologic dressing,&quot; &quot;skin replacement,&quot; &quot;dermal allograft,&quot; &quot;AlloDerm,&quot; &quot;FlexHD,&quot; &quot;Permacol,&quot; and &quot;Strattice.&quot; These were all cross-referenced with &quot;forearm,&quot; &quot;wrist,&quot; and &quot;hand.&quot; Data extraction focused on indications, surgical techniques, clinical outcomes, and complications. Exclusion criteria included regeneration templates, neonatal foreskin, and review articles.RESULTS: More than 100 articles published between 1994 and 2011 were identified. Upon final review, five prospective case-control studies, three retrospective case-control studies, four case reports, one cross-sectional cohort, one prospective consecutive series, and one study type unknown were evaluated. Matrix was most commonly used in burn reconstruction. It has also been used in ligament and joint reconstruction for first carpometacarpal arthritis. One article illustrated the use of porcine matrix in basal joint arthritis, a practice that was abruptly terminated because of a concern over increased infections.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical indications for acellular dermal matrix have increased throughout the last 15 years. Hand surgeons have been cautious but diligent in developing alternative treatment options in hand reconstruction, with a focused effort to reduce donor-site morbidity. Although acellular dermal matrices continue to find innovative uses to solve upper extremity surgical problems, more comparative prospective trials are needed.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,23096981,2012
Advances in the management of Dupuytren disease: collagenase.,"Dupuytren disease (DD) is a benign, generally painless connective tissue disorder affecting the palmar fascia that leads to progressive hand contractures. Mediated by myofibroblasts, the disease most commonly begins as a nodule in the palm or finger, and can progress where pathologic cords form leading to progressive flexion deformity of the involved fingers. The palmar skin overlying the cords may become excessively calloused and contracted and involved joints may develop periarticular fibrosis. Although there is no cure, the sequellae of this affliction can be corrected. This article focuses on the role of collagen in DD and the development of a collagen-specific enzymatic treatment for DD contractures.",Hand clinics,23101605,2012
Results of surgery treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in 115 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder of the hand causing digital flexion contracture. Treatment goals include removing or releasing the fibrotic cord to allow extension of the affected finger(s) and restoration of hand function.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In study period from 2001 through 2008, evaluation was performed in 115 patients. Limited or extensive fasciectomy was performed in all patients. Tubiana classification sheme to rate severity of DD was used.RESULTS: There were 106 male patients ( mean age 62.6 years) and 9 female patients (mean age 66.3 years). Before the operation, 38% of all patients were at Tubiana stage I, 32% were at stage II, 22% were at stage III and 8% were at stage IV. Of all patients, 43% were diagnosed with Dupuytren's in only one finger, 39% in two fingers and 18% in three fingers. In 23% of patients DD were diagnosed on both hands. Limited fasciectomy was peformed in 90.4% of patients and extensive fasciectomy in 9.6% of patients. The Tubiana stage achived after surgery was lower in 98% of patients. As a final result after surgery, 66% of patients didn't have contracture, stage I was reported in 28% and stage II in 3% of patients. There were no patients with Tubiana stage III or more after surgery. Postoperative complications were noted in 18% of patients. Wound healing problems were present 12% of patients. Haematoma was reported 5% of patients. Of all patients 22% had diabetes mellitus.CONCLUSION: DD is much more common in male than in female patients. Most of the patients are diagnosed at Tubiana stage I and II. Surgical correction has led to an improvement in most patients. Limited fasciectomy is still the gold-standard in DD treatment. Extensive fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy is preformed only in most severe cases.","Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)",23097972,2012

[Characteristics of Dupuytren's disease in women. A study of 67 cases].,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical differences of the Dupuytren's disease in gender. Testosterone induces an increase of the Dupuytren's fibroblast proliferation via androgen's receptors. Testosterone rate increases during pregnancy and menopausis. We also reached a link between this factors and the clinical aspects of Dupuytren' disease in the women of our study.METHODS: This retrospective, comparative study was about all women and a randomized number of men, who underwent surgery for Dupuytren' disease between 1980 and 2010. We analysed all the epidemiologic and clinical data, the surgery procedures and the complications. Pre- and postoperative measurements of the extension lack of all the joints were performed with a manual goniometer. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients function. This specific data of women were reached.RESULTS: Sixty-seven women and 69 men were compared. The complex regional pain syndrome was significantly more common in women and the correction of the proximal interphalangeal joint was significantly lower in women. Recurrence rate and mean follow up were not statistically different. Mean DASH score was higher in women. We have not found any association between menopausis, pregnancy and the average age at presentation of the disease, the recurrence rate or the extension rate.CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of the Dupuytren's disease is worse in women than in men. Other studies are necessary to reach the link between the testosterone and the clinical history of the disease in women.",Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,23043989,2012
High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces pain in plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose's disease).,"BACKGROUND: Plantar fibromatosis is a benign disease creating nodules on the medial plantar side of affected patients. While surgical removal is regarded as the therapeutic mainstay, recurrence rates and impairment of daily activities remains substantial. High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave therapy has been suggested to be potentially effective in plantar fibromatosis in terms of pain reduction.HYPOTHESIS: High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces pain in plantar fibromatosis.FINDINGS: A total number of six patients (5 males, 58±4 years) were included with plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose's disease) associated with pain. Three patients were operated on previously, one had concomitant Dupuytren's contracture. High-energy focussed ESWT was applied using a Storz Duolith SD1 (2000 impulses, 3 Hz, 1.24 mJ/mm²) in two sessions with 7 days between. Pain was 6±2 at baseline, 2±1 after 14 days and 1±1 after 3 months. Softening of the nodules was noted by all patients. No adverse effects were noted.CONCLUSIONS: High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave energy reduces pain in painful plantar fibromatosis (Morbus Ledderhose). Further large-scale prospective trials are warranted to elucidate the value of high-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in plantar fibromatosis in terms of recurrence and efficacy.",BMC research notes,23031080,2012
[Development of length of stay and reimbursement in elective hand surgery after the introduction of DRGs in Germany].,"BACKGROUND: Since its introduction in Germany, the DRG (Diagnosis-Related Groups) system is often fraught with negative connotations. Frequent points of criticism are a deterioration of patient care by decreasing length of stay (LOS) in hospital and a decline in reimbursement. The following investigation analyzes and compares the development of length of stay and reimbursement in hand surgery based on the 3 most common elective procedures.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The main diagnoses scaphoid nonunion (PSA), Dupuytren's contracture (DK) and rhizarthrosis (RIA) were evaluated for number of cases, length of stay, reimbursement per day and total reimbursement in 2000 as well as 2010 based on the data of our clinic. Patients covered by the Employers' Liability Insurance were not included. Only inpatient cases were considered.RESULTS: In PSA and RIA an increase in the number of cases is reported (PSA: +11 cases; RIA: +26 cases) and a decrease in DK ( - 7 cases). The sum of the total hospital days declined despite rising case numbers predominantly between 65 (RIA) and 260 days (DK). The average LOS decreased by 3.1 days at DK (48.4%) to 4.1 days at PSA (52.6%). Average revenues per day in 2000 amounted to 379 €, which corresponds to 442 € adjusted for inflation in 2010. Average revenue per day in 2010 was 755 € (RIA), 797 € (PSA) and 876 € (DK). Revenue per case in 2010 were only higher than in 2000, when 5 (RIA) or 6 hospital days (DK and PSA) were not exceeded.CONCLUSION: With declining revenue per case, the average income per day increased by a reduction in hospital days. A positive or at least equivalent revenue situation can thus only be achieved by a distinct concentration of labor and reduction of hospital days under the DRG-system.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",23027336,2012
Dupuytren diathesis and genetic risk.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren disease (DD) is a benign fibrosing disorder of the hand and fingers. Recently, we identified 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DD in a genome-wide association study. These SNPs can be used to calculate a genetic risk score for DD. The aim of this study was to test whether certain clinical characteristics (including the DD diathesis features) of patients with DD are associated with a high genetic risk score.METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, we prospectively invited all DD patients (1,120 in total) to participate. Clinical characteristics were noted using patient- and doctor-completed questionnaires, and blood was obtained for DNA analysis. We analyzed a total of 933 subjects with genetic and clinical data. The 9 previously identified DD SNPs were used to calculate a weighted genetic risk score. Patients were categorized into high and low genetic risk score groups, according to their weighted genetic risk score. Logistic regression was performed to study the association of clinical characteristics with a high genetic risk score.RESULTS: In a univariate regression model, patients with an age of onset of DD younger than 50 years, a family history positive for DD, knuckle pads, and Ledderhose disease were statistically significantly associated with a high genetic risk score. In an additional analysis using high and low genetic risk groups that deviate further from the median, Ledderhose disease was no longer significantly associated with DD.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DD who present with these diathesis features, and predominantly patients with knuckle pads, are more likely to carry more risk alleles for the discovered DD SNPs than patients without these diathesis features.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These markers may prove useful in predicting disease progression or recurrence.",The Journal of hand surgery,23021175,2012
Collagenase for Dupuytren's disease of the thumb.,"Injectable collagenase is an alternative to surgical   treatment for Dupuytren's disease. Previous studies have reported   on the effectiveness of collagenase in finger contractures. This   prospective study reports on the short-term safety and efficacy   of collagenase treatment in five thumb and first web space Dupuytren's   contractures. The thumb and first web space contractures were treated   with injectable collagenase in four consecutive patients (five hands) with   experience of previous surgical digital fasciectomy. The thumb contracture   was measured by angle and span in two planes of thumb extension   and abduction before injection and after manipulation. Collagenase   treatment resulted in release of the contracture with a mean increase   in thumb to index angle from 23° (10° to 35°) to 56° (45° to 60°)   in extension and from 30° (10° to 50°) to 58° (50° to 65°) in abduction   and a mean increase in span from 1.9 cm (1 to 3.5) to 3.9 cm (3   to 5) in extension and from 2.4 cm (1.5 to 3.5) to 3.9 cm (3 to   4.5) in abduction. All patients reported an increased range of movement   and function and described collagenase therapy as preferable to   surgery. In the short-term collagenase is an effective, well-tolerated   and safe alternative to surgery for Dupuytren's disease of the thumb.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Association of HLA-DRB1*01 with Dupuytren's disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 allele frequency in Dupuytren's disease (DD).METHOD: HLA-DRB1 genotypes were analysed by sequence-specific primers (SSPs) in samples collected from 172 men participating in a nested case-control study on the clinical manifestations and progression of DD. Of those, 121 had signs of DD while 51 did not. Of the 121 men with DD, 49 had contracted fingers or had been operated on, while 72 had nodules or fibrous cords in the palms. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were used to evaluate the results.RESULTS: The HLA-DRB1*01 allele was observed in 26 of the 121 affected men (23.7%) but in only four of the controls (7.8%) (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.06-9.75). The HLA-DRB1*01 allele frequency in those affected was 11%, while in the control group it was 4% (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.05-9.03).CONCLUSIONS: This observation indicates a possible association of HLA-DRB1*01 with DD, but further studies are needed for confirmation.",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,22991974,2012
The mechanical environment in Dupuytren's contracture determines cell contractility and associated MMP-mediated matrix remodeling.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are expressed in Dupuytren's contracture and play a role in matrix remodeling. We tested the role of tension on contractility and MMP expression in Dupuytren's nodule and cord cells. Cells were subjected to pre-determined loading patterns of known repeatable magnitudes (static load, unloading, and overloading) and tested for MMP gene expression (MMP-1, -2, -9, -13, and TIMP-1, -2) and force generation using a tension-culture force monitor. Matrix remodeling was assessed by addition of cytochalasin D and residual matrix tension was quantified. Nodule compared to cord and control cells demonstrate greater force generation and remodeling (p &lt; 0.05). Nodule cells subjected to a reduced load and overloading led to threefold increase of MMP-1, -2, and -9 compared to static load, whilst cord and control cells only showed a twofold increase of MMP-9. Nodule cells subjected to overloading showed a twofold increase in TIMP-2 expression, whilst cord and control cells showed a twofold increase in TIMP-1 expression. Nodule cells differ from cord cells by increased force generation in response to changes in the mechanical environment and related MMP/TIMP-mediated matrix remodeling. In turn this may lead to permanent matrix shortening and digital contracture. Interventional therapies should be aimed at nodule cells to prevent contraction and subsequent permanent matrix remodeling.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,22987740,2012
Microarray analysis of Dupuytren's disease cells: the profibrogenic role of the TGF-β inducible p38 MAPK pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a nodular palmar fibromatosis that causes irreversible permanent contracture of fingers and results in the loss of hand function. Surgery still remains the only available solution for DD patients but cannot permanently cure the disease nor reduce high recurrence rates. With this rationale, we designed a study aimed at an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DD. Our major focus was an analysis of the global gene expression profile and signalling pathways in DD cells with the aim of identifying novel biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.METHODS: Primary cells were cultured from surgically removed diseased and healthy tissue. Microarray expression analysis (HG-U133A array, Affymetrix) and qPCR was performed with total RNA isolated from primary DD cells. Mechanistic studies involving inhibition of p38 phosphorylation were performed on normal human fibroblasts' and primary DD cells' in vitro models. Expression of stem cell markers in primary fibroblasts/myofibroblasts was assessed as well.RESULTS: We identified 3 p38MAPK signalling pathway regulatory genes, THBS1, GADD45α and NUAK1, all involved in cellular proliferation and production of the extracellular matrix proteins. Inhibition of the p38MAPK signalling pathway induced down-regulation of myofibroblast markers, α-smooth muscle actin and palladin. A stem-cell like subpopulation positive for CD90 marker was identified among primary DD cells.CONCLUSION: The study reveals involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway as a possible signalling cascade in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. Moreover, a particular stem cell-like CD90(+) subpopulation was identified that might contribute to DD development.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",22965824,2012
[Dupuytren’s disease – the story of an eponym].,"December 5, 1831, baron Guillaume Dupuytren presents at the surgical clinics of the Hotel-Dieu of Paris a report upon &quot;an entirely new subject, with a new theory and a new method of treatment for a disease generally regarded as incurable&quot;. The patient presented had a permanent contraction of the ring finger and adjacent fingers of both hands, which appeared spontaneously without any injury or previous illness. Dupuytren explains he had the opportunity to dissect the hand of a man who died after having had a contraction of the fingers for many years. He defines the cause of the contraction to be the palmar fascia. He describes the operative treatment: aponeurotomy by a transverse incision. &quot;Probably many surgeons (Cline 1808, Astley Cooper 1822) were aware of the palmar aponeurosis producing this condition before Dupuytren's lecture&quot;. &quot;Thoroughness of his demonstration, the brilliance of the presentation and the supremacy of his surgical authority combined to link permanently the name of Dupuytren with this hand deformity&quot; (J.

Correction of contracture and recurrence rates of Dupuytren contracture following invasive treatment: the importance of clear definitions.,"PURPOSE: To call attention to the wide variety of definitions for recurrence that have been employed in studies of different invasive procedures for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture and how this important limitation has contributed to the wide range of reported results.METHODS: This study reviewed definitions and rates of contracture correction and recurrence in patients undergoing invasive treatment of Dupuytren contracture. A literature search was carried out in January 2011 using the terms &quot;Dupuytren&quot; AND (&quot;fasciectomy&quot; OR &quot;fasciotomy&quot; OR &quot;dermofasciectomy&quot; OR &quot;aponeurotomy&quot; OR &quot;aponeurectomy&quot;) and limited to studies in English.RESULTS: The search returned 218 studies, of which 21 had definitions, quantitative results for contracture correction and recurrence, and a sample size of at least 20 patients. Definitions for correction of contracture and recurrence varied greatly among articles and were almost always qualitative. Percentages of patients who achieved correction of contracture (ie, responder rate) when evaluated at various times after completion of surgery ranged from 15% to 96% for fasciectomy/aponeurectomy. Responder rates were not reported for fasciotomy/aponeurotomy. Recurrence rates ranged from 12% to 73% for patients treated with fasciectomy/aponeurectomy and from 33% to 100% for fasciotomy/aponeurotomy. Review of these reports underscored the difficulty involved in comparing correction of contracture and recurrence rates for different surgical interventions because of differences in definition and duration of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Clearly defined objective definitions for correction of contracture and for recurrence are needed for more meaningful comparisons of results achieved with different surgical interventions.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Recurrence after surgical intervention for Dupuytren contracture is common. This study, which evaluated reported rates of recurrence following surgical treatment of Dupuytren contracture, provides clinicians with practical information regarding expected long-term outcomes of surgical treatment choices.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and decision analysis III.",The Journal of hand surgery,22938804,2012

Late complications of clinical clostridium histolyticum collagenase use in Dupuytren's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: While Dupuytren's disease can cause disabling contractures requiring open surgery, a less-invasive option using Clostridium Histolyticum collagenase (CHC) via percutaneous injection was recently reported. A recent prospective, randomized trial demonstrated few complications during 90 days follow-up, however did not assess any longer term follow-up for these patients. Long-term outcomes in this setting have not been adequately reported, and the current manuscript aims to identify late complications from the clinical use of percutaneous CHC.METHODS: The current manuscript reports an extended 12-month follow-up for a cohort of twelve of patients enrolled in the original prospective, randomized trial, treated at a single institution. An analysis of complications requiring surgical intervention was undertaken.RESULTS: Two of twelve patients reported debilitating pain and triggering requiring surgical intervention. Extensive deep-tissue scarring and adhesions were identified, providing the first visual and qualitative analysis of the pathologic effects of CHC.CONCLUSION: Late complications from CHC use can and have occurred, outside the follow-up period of the initial phase III trials. Longer term follow-up of such patients is thus essential, and further investigation and characterization of the late effects of CHC use is warranted.",PloS one,22912868,2012

Using functional genomics to identify drug targets: a Dupuytren's disease example.,"Research into the molecular mechanism of Dupuytren's disease (DD) illustrates all the problems common to drug discovery in orphan diseases, but also in more commonly investigated ailments. Current findings characterize DD as a disease with complex molecular pathology, with changes in expression of multiple genes and proteins as well as many contributing risk factors. Some of the observed changes include genes and proteins that have been identified in a number of other pathological processes, such as TGF-β, some which may be more specific to DD, such as ADAM12, and undoubtedly also some that have yet to be discovered in future studies. When all these results are taken into consideration, it can be deduced that DD is an end result of several pathological processes that can have many points of origin, and probably involves several subtypes that give rise to sufficiently similar clinical symptoms to be unified under a single medical term. Such breadth of view has become possible with the advent of functional genomics methods and system-wide overview of the molecular processes, which highlight molecular players and processes that might not be intuitively obvious from symptoms, as is the case with the observed parallels with wound-healing processes. As functional genomics methods allow researchers to compile a more complete image of the molecular mechanisms involved in DD pathogenesis, they also help to propose new drug targets that can be employed to develop an effective pharmacological treatment for DD.

Sibling recurrence risk in Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a complex condition, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its aetiology. We aimed to quantify the extent to which genetic factors predispose to the disease, through the calculation of sibling recurrence risk (ls), and to calculate the proportion of heritability accounted for by currently known genetic loci. From 174 siblings of patients with surgically confirmed disease, 100 were randomly selected. Controls were recruited from patients attending an ophthalmology outpatient clinic for eye conditions unrelated to diabetes. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between the case and control groups. In siblings, 47% had Dupuytren's disease, compared with 10% of controls, giving a ls of 4.5. Currently known loci that predispose to Dupuytren's disease account for 12.1% of the total heritability of the disease. Dupuytren's disease was significantly more common in siblings than in controls. These results accurately quantify the magnitude of the genetic predisposition to Dupuytren's disease.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",22791609,2012
Dupuytren's disease metabolite analyses reveals alterations following initial short-term fibroblast culturing.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is an ill-defined fibroproliferative disorder affecting the palm of the hand, resulting in progressive and irreversible digital contracture. In view of the abnormal gene dysregulation found in DD, and its potential effect on metabolites at a functional level, we chose to examine the metabolic profile involved in DD. Using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to generate metabolic fingerprints of cultured cells, we compared the profiles of DD cords and nodules (1) against the unaffected transverse palmar fascia (internal control), (2) against carpal ligamentous fascia (external control), and (3) against fibroblasts from fat surrounding the nodule and skin overlying the nodule (environmental control). We also determined the effects of serial passaging of the cells on DD fingerprints. Subsequently, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed for metabolic profiling in order to identify metabolites characteristic of the DD tissue phenotypes. We developed a robust metabolomic analysis procedure of DD using cultured fibroblasts derived from DD tissues. Our carefully controlled culture conditions, combined with assessment of metabolic phenotypes by FT-IR and GC-MS, enabled us to demonstrate metabolic differences between DD and unaffected transverse palmar fascia and between DD and healthy control tissue. In early passage (0-3) the metabolic differences were clear, but cells from subsequent passages (4-6) started to lose this distinction between diseased and non-diseased origin. The dysregulated metabolites we identified were leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, cysteine, aspartic acid, glycerol-3-phosphate and the vitamin precursor to coenzyme A. Early passage DD cells exhibit a clear metabolic profile, in which central metabolic pathways appear to be involved. Experimental conditions have been identified in which these DD data are reproducible. The experimental reproducibility will be useful in DD diagnostics and for DD systems biology.",Molecular bioSystems,22772395,2012
Whole genome and global expression profiling of Dupuytren's disease: systematic review of current findings and future perspectives.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibroproliferative disorder affecting the palmar fascia, which may lead to permanent contracture of the affected digit. Profiling studies investigating DD at whole-genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels have been carried out, from which large numbers of candidate genes potentially involved in DD have been reported. This review focuses on identifying genes reported by multiple studies or validated by multiple experimental techniques, as well as signalling pathways suggested to contribute to DD. Meta-analysis was also carried out on three microarray datasets. Twenty-one genes were found to be reported as dysregulated in multiple gene expression microarrays, seven of which have been further validated by other experimental methods. Sixty-four genes determined to be dsyregulated by meta-analysis correlate to those reported by published microarray studies. In addition, several pathways have been proposed to be involved in DD by whole-genome or global expression profiling. Further investigation in these genes and pathways, and correlating them to genotypes or environmental factors for DD, may aid in further elucidation of mechanisms involved in DD pathogenesis.",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,22772327,2012
Percutaneous needle fasciotomy for recurrent Dupuytren disease.,"PURPOSE: Increasing options to treat Dupuytren disease include percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF), a minimally invasive technique that has proven to be effective for the treatment of primary disease. However, its effect on recurrent disease is not clear.METHODS: We studied 30 patients with recurrent Dupuytren disease in 40 fingers, with a mean follow-up of 4.4 years. Primary outcome measures were total passive extension deficit reduction and interval to a second recurrence, defined as an increase of more than 30° compared with the result at the end of the previous treatment. We noted complications.RESULTS: Total passive extension reduction was 76%. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy was especially effective for the metacarpophalangeal joint, with an average reduction of 93%, whereas the average reduction in the proximal interphalangeal joint was 57%. A total of 50% of patients did not develop a secondary recurrence during follow-up. The other 50% did, and we treated recurrence within an average of 1.4 years after PNF. By means of PNF, we postponed tertiary treatment an average of 2.9 years starting from the initial treatment for Dupuytren disease. We successfully treated all secondary recurrences by limited fasciectomy, according to patients' wishes. We noted no major adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy can be applied effectively for recurrent disease; 50% of patients remain free of recurrence for a mean of 4.4 years. If a secondary recurrence occurs, it does so relatively early after treatment. Patients must therefore be willing to accept this uncertainty in the context of the advantages of PNF, such as fast recovery, low complication rate, and minimal invasiveness.",The Journal of hand surgery,22763055,2012
Bassoonists' medical problems-current state of knowledge.,"Specific musical instruments can be a source of physical problems to their players. Based on reviews of the literature and personal experience, this paper summarizes current knowledge of problems affecting musicians who play instruments in the bassoon family (including the bassoon, contrabassoon, and several other instruments). Prevalence rates are higher in reports of surveys (ranging up to 86%), compared to clinical reports of patients seen and treated. Significant risk factors include young age, small body size, female gender, and use of large instruments. Problems unique to bassoonists are rare; most physical difficulties also are seen in general musculoskeletal clinical practices and in musicians playing all types of instruments. The left upper extremity is more commonly affected by overuse-related conditions in bassoonists. Non-playing-related problems are equally important for consideration (such as degenerative disorders and acute trauma), since they also affect practice and performance. Little experimental data exist to validate current and widely-held principles of treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention.",Medical problems of performing artists,22739824,2012
Efficacy of collagenase in patients who did and did not have previous hand surgery for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is a non-surgical, efficacious therapy for Dupuytren's contracture (DC). This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of CCH in patients with previous DC surgery. Data from 12 CCH clinical trials were pooled. At screening, patients provided details about the type/date of previous DC surgery. Reviewers coded descriptions to the Operated Hand, finger, and joint. Of 1082 patients, 422 (39%) had previous DC surgery. For these patients with previous surgery, the CCH treatment was coded on the Operated (n = 206) or Non-operated Hand (n = 196). End-points included changes in fixed-flexion contracture (FFC) and range of motion (ROM). Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. After treatment with CCH, FFC at metacarpophalangeal joints was reduced by 75% in previously Operated Hands and by 80% for Non-operated Hands (p = 0.6). Improvements in ROM were 32° and 32°, respectively (p = 0.9). For proximal inter-phalangeal joints, the reductions in FFC for the Operated and Non-operated Hands were 52% and 50%, respectively (p = 0.6); improvements in ROM were 24° and 26°, respectively (p = 0.3). Some AE rates were significantly higher in the Operated vs Non-operated Hand groups, but were not clinically relevant. There were no between-group significant differences in AE duration (p &gt; 0.08). Previous surgery for DC does not affect efficacy or safety of CCH, suggesting CCH is an option in patients with recurring DC. Some AE rates were significantly higher, but not clinically relevant.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,22670890,2012
Deteriorating tactile sensation in patients with hand syndromes associated with diabetes: a two-year observational study.,"AIMS: To observe the natural history of hand function during a two-year period in participants with hand syndromes associated with diabetes and to determine factors related to changing function.METHODS: Hand function was measured over three annual visits using Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and SF-36v2 questionnaires, grip strength, light touch and 9-hole peg tests. Light touch was tested with WEST monofilaments at 7 sites on the hand (score 35 to 0). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, Spearman's correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.RESULTS: Participants (n=60) were aged 61 ± 10.5 years, 57% female, diagnosed with diabetes and at least one of four associated hand disorders. Presentations of carpal tunnel syndrome, or past release (n=27, 45%) and trigger finger (n=24, 40%) were common. Tactile sensation was reduced during the two-year period (median, range; 30 months, 25-40 months). Initial median (inter-quartile range) scores for the dominant hand of 25.5 (22-28.5) were reduced to 23 (21.5-27). This sensory loss was weakly associated with HbA1c (r=0.30, p=0.05) and occurred predominantly in participants with trigger finger (p=0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Light touch perception was reduced in longstanding diabetic hand syndromes. Tactile abnormalities that were detected by clinical examination progressed during a two year period and were related to metabolic control and musculoskeletal diagnosis.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,22658410,2012
Bilateral Dupuytren's contractures of the thumb interphalangeal joints.,"Dupuytren's disease was first described by Baron Guillaume Dupuytren in 1831. He outlined the pathology of palmar fascia thickening and contracture resulting in flexion of one or more digits. Dupuytren's disease usually affects the little or ring fingers, with the thumb rarely affected. Furthermore, the thumb in isolation is only affected in 0.5% of cases, with contracture at the metacarpophalangeal joint. We present a unique and interesting case of Dupuytren's disease predominantly of the thumbs, with isolated contractures bilaterally at the interphalangeal joints, in a 59 year old lady with epilepsy who was otherwise fit and well. To our knowledge this disease pattern has never been reported in the literature. Furthermore a relevant literature review of Dupuytren's disease affecting the thumb, in particular the interphalangeal joint, is presented. Our interesting and unique case reinforces the notion that the disease pathogenesis is diverse and multifactorial, and provides a further interesting example for the literature.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",22652288,2012
The use of skeletal extension torque in reversing Dupuytren contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint.,"Dupuytren contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint can be reversed by an extension torque transmitted from an external device, the Digit Widget, by skeletal pins to the middle phalanx. This extension torque, generated by the same elastic bands dentists use to align teeth, gradually restores length to soft tissues palmar to the PIP joint's axis of rotation. Simultaneously, tissues dorsal to the joint's axis will shorten toward normal length as the PIP progressively straightens. Although the contractile nodules and bands of Dupuytren disease may be excised either before or after reversal of the joint's contracture, a 2-staged approach is preferred: (1) reverse the PIP flexion contracture, and (2) excise the diseased tissue from the straightened finger. We believe this 2-staged approach yields better results. In addition, it is technically easier to avoid injury to nerves and arteries while excising the nodules and bands, when one operates through palmar skin of more nearly normal length.",The Journal of hand surgery,22652177,2012
Evaluation of a mitochondrial DNA mutation in maternally inherited and sporadic cases of Dupuytren disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to test the hypothesis that Dupuytren disease (DD) is associated with a previously reported mutation in mitochondrial DNA at position 2839.METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine cases of DD and an equal number of matched controls were identified in Marshfield Clinic's Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP). Clinical data used to describe the cohort were abstracted from the electronic medical records of the population. Genetic analysis of all the cases and controls was done using a custom synthesis TaqMan assay, while genetic analysis of sixteen of the above cases with a familial history of DD was performed by mitochondrial DNA sequencing at position C2839A.RESULTS: Cases and controls were evenly distributed with 167 (62%) men and 102 (38%) women. The majority, 264 (98%) of the cases and controls were white non-Hispanic. Of the 269 cases, 16 were found to have a familial history of DD. Two cases had a maternal history, eight a paternal history, five an affected sibling, and one a paternal grandfather. All cases and controls were found to have only the C allele at the site of the reported mitochondrial C2839A polymorphism.CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported mitochondrial mutation was not present in our small, maternally inherited cohort or in the total population of 538 cases and controls. This finding does not support the reported incidence of this polymorphism in 90% of the affected population with a maternal inheritance, and calls into question the role of the C2839A mitochondrial DNA polymorphism in familial or sporadic cases of DD.",Clinical medicine &amp; research,22634541,2012
"Steroid injection and needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren contracture: a randomized, controlled study.","PURPOSE: To compare flexion deformity at 6 months in patients with Dupuytren contracture who had percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA) combined with a series of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injections to that of patients who had PNA alone.METHODS: Forty-seven patients with Dupuytren disease who were candidates for PNA (at least 1 contracture of at least 20°) participated in the study. Patients were randomized either to receive TA injections immediately following and 6 weeks and 3 months after the procedure or to receive no injections. Injections were administered into cords. The number of injections and the amount of TA per injection was determined based on the number of digits involved and the cord size. All subjects returned for 3 follow-up visits after the procedure, and contractures were measured using a goniometer. Change in total active extension deficit (TAED) was analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance to assess for differences between groups, time points, and interaction between group and time point. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables of interest. Continuous measures were summarized using means and standard deviations.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TAED between groups before cord aponeurotomy. Correction at 6 months was 87% of preoperative TAED for the TA group versus 64% for the control group. This difference was statistically significant. The amount of TA administered did not correlate with TAED improvement.CONCLUSIONS: The study group who received TA in combination with PNA experienced a significantly greater degree of correction of flexion deformity at 6 months than those who had PNA alone.",The Journal of hand surgery,22633226,2012
X-linked recessive polyfibromatosis manifesting with spontaneous keloid scars and Dupuytren's contracture.,We present a patient with keloid scars and Dupuytren's contracture comprising the polyfibromatosis syndrome; four members over three generations of his family are also affected.

Painful nodules and cords in Dupuytren disease.,"PURPOSE: The etiology of Dupuytren disease is unclear. Pain is seldom described in the literature. Patients are more often disturbed by impaired extension of the fingers. We recently treated a series of patients who had had painful nodules for more than 1 year, and we therefore decided to investigate them for a possible anatomical correlate.METHODS: Biopsies were taken during surgery from patients with Dupuytren disease and stained to enable detection of neuronal tissue.RESULTS: We treated 17 fingers in 10 patients. Intraoperatively, 10 showed tiny nerve branches passing into or crossing the fibrous bands or nodules. Of 13 biopsies, 6 showed nerve fibers embedded in fibrous tissue, 3 showed perineural or intraneural fibrosis or both, and 3 showed true neuromas. Enlarged Pacinian corpuscles were isolated from 1 sample. All patients were pain free after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Although Dupuytren disease is generally considered painless, we treated a series of early stage patients with painful disease. Intraoperative inspection and histological examination of tissue samples showed that nerve tissue was involved in all cases. The pain might have been due to local nerve compression by the fibromatosis or the Dupuytren disease itself. We, therefore, suggest that the indication for surgery in Dupuytren disease be extended to painful nodules for more than 1 year, even in the early stages of the disease in the absence of functional deficits, with assessment of tissue samples for histological changes in nerves.",The Journal of hand surgery,22560560,2012
Fibroblasts from phenotypically normal palmar fascia exhibit molecular profiles highly similar to fibroblasts from active disease in Dupuytren's Contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by the progressive development of a scar-like collagen-rich cord that affects the palmar fascia of the hand and leads to digital flexion contractures. DC is most commonly treated by surgical resection of the diseased tissue, but has a high reported recurrence rate ranging from 27% to 80%. We sought to determine if the transcriptomic profiles of fibroblasts derived from DC-affected palmar fascia, adjacent phenotypically normal palmar fascia, and non-DC palmar fascial tissues might provide mechanistic clues to understanding the puzzle of disease predisposition and recurrence in DC.METHODS: To achieve this, total RNA was obtained from fibroblasts derived from primary DC-affected palmar fascia, patient-matched unaffected palmar fascia, and palmar fascia from non-DC patients undergoing carpal tunnel release (6 patients in each group). These cells were grown on a type-1 collagen substrate (to better mimic their in vivo environments). Microarray analyses were subsequently performed using Illumina BeadChip arrays to compare the transcriptomic profiles of these three cell populations. Data were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM v3.02), hierarchical clustering, concordance mapping and Venn diagram.RESULTS: We found that the transcriptomic profiles of DC-disease fibroblasts and fibroblasts from unaffected fascia of DC patients exhibited a much greater overlap than fibroblasts derived from the palmar fascia of patients undergoing carpal tunnel release. Quantitative real time RT-PCR confirmed the differential expression of select genes validating the microarray data analyses. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that predisposition and recurrence in DC may stem, at least in part, from intrinsic similarities in the basal gene expression of diseased and phenotypically unaffected palmar fascia fibroblasts. These data also demonstrate that a collagen-rich environment differentially alters gene expression in these cells. In addition, Ingenuity pathway analysis of the specific biological pathways that differentiate DC-derived cells from carpal tunnel-derived cells has identified the potential involvement of microRNAs in this fibroproliferative disorder.CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the transcriptomic profiles of DC-disease fibroblasts and fibroblasts from unaffected palmar fascia in DC patients are highly similar, and differ significantly from the transcriptomic profiles of fibroblasts from the palmar fascia of patients undergoing carpal tunnel release.",BMC medical genomics,22559715,2012
Multiple concurrent collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections to Dupuytren's cords: an exploratory study.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder characterized by development of nodules and collagen cords within the palmar fascia of the hand. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is currently approved in adults with DC for the nonsurgical treatment of a single palpable cord during a 30-day treatment cycle. This open-label pilot study was designed to examine the safety, efficacy, and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of injecting two cords (affected joints) with multiple doses of CCH concurrently into the same hand in subjects with DC and multiple contractures.METHODS: Twelve subjects with DC were enrolled, each with ≥3 contractures caused by palpable cords. Efficacy assessments were taken 30 days after treatment and adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout. In the first treatment period, all subjects were injected with a single dose of CCH (0.58 mg) into a single cord. The same subjects entered a second treatment period 30 days later, where two different cords (affected joints) were injected concurrently on the same hand. A finger extension procedure was performed 24 hours after each administration of CCH to disrupt the enzymatically weakened cord.RESULTS: For metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints, mean contracture reduction per joint treated was 29.0 ± 20.7 degrees following single injection vs 30.3 ± 10.9 degrees per treated joint following multiple injections. For proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, mean reduction in contracture was 30.7 ± 21.1 and 22.1 ± 4.9 degrees per treated joint, respectively, for the two periods. All patients (100%) were either &quot;quite satisfied&quot; or &quot;very satisfied&quot; following either treatment cycle. The most common treatment-related AEs were edema peripheral, contusion, and pain in the treated extremity; the differences in severity for local effects of the injections were minimal between treatment periods. No serious treatment-related AEs or systemic complications were reported.CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary evidence that two cords (affected joints) can be treated concurrently with CCH with similar efficacy and safety as cords treated individually in a sequential fashion. Multiple concurrent injections would eliminate the 30-day wait between single treatments and allow for rapid and effective treatment of patients with multiple affected joints, a significant advantage for both patient and physician.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry #ACTRN12610001045000.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,22540636,2012
Percutaneous needle fasciotomy in Dupuytren's contracture: is it a viable technique?,"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of 44 percutaneous needle fasciotomies for Dupuytren's contracture, performed from March 2005 to June 2010. The mean age of the 36 patients was 58 years and the mean follow-up period was 28 months. The assessment was based on the clinical records and clinical evaluation. Pre-operative and postoperative total passive extension deficit and complications were registered. Recurrence and patient satisfaction were also noted. The results in stage I and II of Tubiana were interesting, with an average improvement of more than 70%. For more severe deformities, the correction obtained was not so satisfactory and decreased significantly over time. The cumulative rate of minor complications was significant (11/44) but there were no major complications or permanent sequelae. Most of the patients were satisfied with the result and would recommend the procedure or would be willing to repeat it if necessary. The recurrence rate was 9%. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy appeared in this study as a minimally invasive, simple and fast technique with low morbidity. These features make this technique a valid alternative in mild stages of Dupuytren's disease.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,22523924,2012
"Expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2, TGF-β1, and decorin in Dupuytren's contracture.","To investigate the mechanisms underlying matrix deposition in Dupuytren's disease, the expression of gelatinase A (MMP-2), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), decorin (DCN), and periostin was studied. The level of relative MMP-2 activation was investigated using zymography. The mRNA expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2, TGF-β1, and DCN was detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), while the presence of protein was detected using immunohistochemical (IHC) and Western blot techniques. The level of MMP-2 activation was significantly elevated in tissues with Dupuytren's contracture. RT-PCR demonstrated significantly higher expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2, TGF-β1, and DCN mRNA in the pathological tissues; and the IHC and immunoblotting studies revealed elevated expression of TGF-β1, DCN, and periostin. The balance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was disrupted in patients with Dupuytren's disease. TGF-β1, DCN, and periostin are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis in Dupuytren's contracture.",Connective tissue research,22512703,2012
[Alterations of cell phenotype in Dupuytren's disease--an in vitro analysis].,"INTRODUCTION: Despite its potential complications, partial aponeurectomy still is the mainstay of treatment whenever it comes to significant contracture in Dupuytren's disease. With the goal in mind to identify new therapeutic strategies we isolated and characterised cells from healthy palmar aponeurosis (Kon) and compared them to cells isolated from palmar aponeurosis of patients with a primary manifestation of Dupuytren's disease (PrimDup) as well as from patients with recurrent Dupuytren's disease (RezDup). As cells from palmar aponeurosis from patients with Dupuytren's disease share characteristics with stem cells, such as the ability to differentiate into other cell types, we analysed the stemness, morphology and integrin receptor profiles of the cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 Dupuytren samples were collected from regular partial aponeurectomy procedures. From these, 3 donors without extrinsic risk factors were selected per group (RezDup, PrimDup). Cells were isolated and expanded under standard cell culture conditions. Cells from healthy patients served as control (Kon). Growth curves were produced. Cells were subjected to osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation using standard protocols. Semiquantitative PCR analysis of the integrins α2, β3, β5 and fibronectin was performed.RESULTS: PrimDup cells proliferated significantly faster than control cells, which in turn proliferated faster than RezDup cells. Both PrimDup and control cells went into senescence after approximately 40 days whereas RezDup cells proliferated over the entire period of 100 days. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was best in cells derived from Dupuytren patients while Kon cells differentiated poorly. PCR analysis revealed that fibronectin-binding integrins β3 and β5 are upregulated in Dupuytren's disease.CONCLUSIONS: PrimDup cells grow faster than the other cell types suggesting that their growth regulation may be altered. The fact that RezDup cells do not reach senescence over 100 days in culture indicates that senescence regulating factors may be altered. As cells from Dupuytren patients differentiate better along the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, they probably possess a higher level of stemness. Their modified integrin profile may be a key to future therapies.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",22495955,2012
WNT2 locus is involved in genetic susceptibility of Peyronie's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Peyronie's disease (PD) is a fibromatosis of the penis, with a pathology very similar to what is seen in the hand (palmar fascia) in Dupuytren's disease (DD). Recently, we performed a genome-wide association study and identified nine genetic loci containing common variants associated with DD. Seven of these loci mapped within or near genes of the canonical WNT pathway and each locus yielded relatively large odds ratios (ORs) for DD disease status.AIM: Given the clinical overlap between PD and DD, we examined whether the nine DD susceptibility loci are also involved in PD.METHODS: An association study was performed using a case/control design. From 2007 to 2010, we prospectively included 111 men who had been clinically diagnosed with PD. Control subjects (N = 490 males) were randomly drawn from a population-based cohort from the same region of the Netherlands. Allele frequencies in the 111 PD cases and 490 controls were compared using a 1-degree-of-freedom basic chi-square test. A P value &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for the nine tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was considered statistically significant (i.e., P &lt; 0.0056).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association of genetic markers (SNPs) with PD.RESULTS: We observed significant association with SNP rs4730775 at the wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 2 (WNT2) locus on chromosome 7 (P = 0.0015, OR 0.61), but found no evidence for the other eight loci being involved with PD despite the large effect size seen for some of these variants in DD. The WNT2 association was even more significant after we removed 15 patients with comorbid DD.CONCLUSIONS: WNT2 is a susceptibility locus for PD and our finding provides evidence for a partly shared genetic susceptibility between PD and DD.",The journal of sexual medicine,22489561,2012
"Results of needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren contracture in over 1,000 fingers.","PURPOSE: To critically review the efficacy, recurrence rate, and complications of needle aponeurotomy (NA) for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture.METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the results of NA for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture. We included in the study all patients who had NA performed for metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture of 20° or greater between March 2005 and May 2008. There were 474 patients with 1,013 fingers treated. The average age was 62 years (range, 33-92 y). Pre-procedure MP joint contracture averaged 35° (range, 15° to 95°), and PIP joint 50° (range, 15° to 110°). Immediately postprocedure and at least 3 years after treatment (range, 3.0-6.2 y), we measured MP and PIP joint contractures and reviewed records for complications.RESULTS: MP joint contractures were corrected an average of 99% and PIP contractures an average of 89% immediately postprocedure. At final follow-up, 72% of the correction was maintained for MP joints and 31% for PIP joints. The difference between the final corrections for MP versus PIP joints was statistically significant. When we compared the final results of patients age 55 years and older versus under 55 years, we found a statistically significant difference at both MP and PIP joints, with greater correction maintained in the older group. Gender differences were not statistically significant. Needle aponeurotomy provided successful correction to 5° or less contracture immediately postprocedure in 98% (791) of MP joints and 67% (350) of PIP joints. There was recurrence of 20° or less over the original postprocedure corrected level in 80% (646) of MP joints and 35% (183) of PIP joints. Complications were rare except for skin tears, which occurred in 3.4% (34) of digits.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that NA is a safe procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. The complication rate was low, but recurrences were frequent in younger patients and for PIP contractures.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,22464232,2012
[Dupuytren's contracture].,"Dupuytren's contracture forms nodules and fibril bundles causing the fingers to contract. The pathological tissue contains myofibroblasts exhibiting properties of fibrocytes and smooth muscle cell myoblasts. The disease has a clear-cut family predisposition, but its etiology remains unclear. Diabetes, smoking, heavy drinking and mechanical irritation of the palm are regarded as predisposing factors. Dupuytren's contracture is treated surgically in cases with the limitation of extension in the metacarpophalangeal joints over 30 degrees and 20 degrees in the proximal interphalangeal joints.",Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja,22448555,2012
Interrater reliability in finger joint goniometer measurement in Dupuytren's disease.,"We investigated interrater reliability of motion (ROM) measurement in the finger joints of people with Dupuytren's disease. Eight raters measured flexion and extension of the three finger joints in one affected finger of each of 13 people with different levels of severity of Dupuytren's disease, giving 104 measures of joints and motions. Reliability measures, represented by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of the mean (SEM), and differences between raters with the highest and lowest mean scores, were calculated. ICCs ranged from .832 to .973 depending on joint and motion. The SEM was ≤3° for all joints and motions. Differences in mean between highest and lowest raters were larger for flexion than for extension; the largest difference was in the distal interphalangeal joint. The results indicate that following these standardized guidelines, the interrater reliability of goniometer measurements is high for digital ROM in people with Dupuytren's disease.",The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association,22389944,2012
In vitro study of novel collagenase (XIAFLEX®) on Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts displays unique drug related properties.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign, fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia, with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and over-production of cytokines and growth factors, resulting in digital fixed flexion contractures limiting hand function and patient quality of life. Surgical fasciectomy is the gold standard treatment but is invasive and has associated morbidity without limiting disease recurrence. Injectable Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH)--Xiaflex®--is a novel, nonsurgical option with clinically proven in vivo reduction of DD contractures but with limited in vitro data demonstrating its cellular and molecular effects. The aim of this study was to delineate the effects of CCH on primary fibroblasts isolated from DD and non-DD anatomical sites (using RTCA, LDH, WST-1, FACS, qRT-PCR, ELISA and In-Cell Quantitative Western Blotting) to compare the efficacy of varying concentrations of Xiaflex® against a reagent grade Collagenase, Collagenase A. Results demonstrated that DD nodule and cord fibroblasts had greater proliferation than those from fat and skin. Xiaflex® exposure resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular spreading, attachment and proliferation, with cellular recovery after enzyme removal. Unlike Collagenase A, Xiaflex® did not cause apoptosis. Collagen expression patterns were significantly (p&lt;0.05) different in DD fibroblasts across anatomical sites - the highest levels of collagen I and III were detected in DD nodule, with DD cord and fat fibroblasts demonstrating a smaller increase in both collagen expression relative to DD skin. Xiaflex® significantly (p&lt;0.05) down-regulated ECM components, cytokines and growth factors in a dose-dependent manner. An in vitro scratch wound assay model demonstrated that, at low concentrations, Xiaflex® enabled a faster fibroblast reparatory migration into the wound, whereas, at high concentrations, this process was significantly (p&lt;0.05) inhibited. This is the first report elucidating potential mechanisms of action of Xiaflex® on Dupuytren fibroblasts, offering a greater insight and a better understanding of its effect in DD.",PloS one,22384021,2012
Direct and indirect costs associated with Dupuytren's contracture.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare direct (medical and drug) and indirect (work loss) costs between privately insured US employees with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and demographically matched controls without DC.METHODS: Employees aged 18-64 with ≥ 1 DC diagnosis (ICD-9-CM: 728.6, 718.44) with service dates 1/1/2000-3/31/2009 were selected from a de-identified, privately insured claims database (n∼3,000,000). The index date was defined as the most recent DC diagnosis with continuous eligibility for 6 months prior (baseline period) and 1 year after (study period) diagnosis. Employees with DC were matched 1:1 on age, region, gender, and index date to controls without DC, Peyronie's, or Ledderhose disease diagnoses in their claims histories. Descriptive analyses compared demographic characteristics, comorbidities, resource utilization, direct costs, and indirect costs inflated to 2009 dollars.RESULTS: DC employees (n=1406, mean age 49 years) with matched controls met the inclusion criteria. DC employees compared with controls had significantly (all p&lt;0.05) higher baseline comorbidities, including hyperlipidemia (21.1% vs 15.6%), hypothyroidism (3.5% vs 2.0%), cancer (3.1% vs 1.5%), and diabetes (8.1% vs 3.6%). During the study period, DC employees had significantly (all p&lt;0.01) higher rates of inpatient stays (7.7% vs 5.3%), emergency department visits (19.8% vs 13.9%), outpatient visits (100.0% vs 78.4%), physical therapy visits (30.2% vs 7.2%), and any prescription use (85.0% vs 69.2%), as well as higher mean work loss days (14.2 vs 7.3). DC employees had on average significantly (all p&lt;0.01) higher annual direct costs ($5974 vs $3175), indirect costs ($2737 vs $1309), and total costs ($8712 vs $4485) compared with controls during the study period.LIMITATIONS: Findings did not account for lost productivity at work and were based on a privately insured, employed population, which may not be generalizable to all DC patients.CONCLUSIONS: Employees with DC had substantially higher comorbidity rates, utilization, and direct and indirect costs compared with demographically matched controls.",Journal of medical economics,22369346,2012
Assessment of potential cross-reactivity of human endogenous matrix metalloproteinases with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum antibodies in human sera obtained from patients with Dupuytren's contracture.,"Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) contains a fixed ratio of class I (AUX-I) and class II (AUX-II) collagenases and is used as treatment for Dupuytren's contracture. These two Zn-dependent enzymes, produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium histolyticum, are related functionally to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which, among other functions, degrade the extracellular matrix. Since AUX-I and AUX-II exhibit sequence similarities to human MMPs, we assessed MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), MMP-8 (collagenase 2), and MMP-13 (collagenase 3) for cross-reactivity with anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies in patient serum. Serum samples from 71 subjects enrolled in a long-term clinical study (58 males and 13 females; 63 ± 10 years old [mean ± standard error]) were evaluated for cross-reactivity with the five MMPs using the two validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Inhibition cutoff points for anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies were based on assay inhibition obtained with a nonspecific protein, bovine gamma globulin, which was tested for each clinical sample. No MMP cross-reactivity was found for any of the 71 clinical antibody-positive sera evaluated. Sequence identity assessments indicated minimal, nonmeaningful alignments of the MMPs and AUX-I/AUX-II. Furthermore, clinical adverse event assessments indicated no safety signals related to MMP inhibition. The bioanalytical results, sequence identity, and clinical assessments consistently did not demonstrate cross-reactivity between CCH antidrug antibodies and endogenous human matrix metalloproteinases. The results presented here suggest that treatment of Dupuytren's contracture patients with CCH does not lead to any clinical adverse events associated with MMP inhibition.",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,22357647,2012
Management of severe Dupuytren's contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint with use of a central slip facilitation device.,"Thirty-eight fingers in 27 patients with Dupuytren's contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) in excess of 70° were treated using a staged technique. The first stage involved applying a mini external fixator across the PIPJ for continuous extension over 6 weeks with intensive hand therapy to maintain mobility of the joint and help correct the deformity. Twice weekly during hand therapy sessions the tension of the elastic band across the mini ex-fix was increased, allowing that full active flexion of the PIPJ against the elastic band could still be achieved. The second stage, 4 weeks after the external fixator was applied, involved an open palm technique of fasciectomy for the contracted cords restricting metacarpophalangeal joint movement and dermofasciectomy with full-thickness skin grafting over the proximal phalanx for bands restricting PIPJ movement. The external fixator was used to maintain active extension force until the graft healed. It was generally removed in the outpatient clinic under ring block 2 weeks after the second stage procedure. The patients were followed for a mean of 20.6 (6-48) months. The mean preoperative PIPJ deformity improved from 75° to 37° postoperatively. Overall, 69% of results were rated as good to excellent. Only one patient reported any on-going functional problems. There were eight cases of pin site infections and one case each of loose pins, osteoarthritics at the PIPJ, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and disease recurrence needing PIPJ fusion. We conclude that our simple staged procedure is a valid alternative in the management of severe Dupuytren's PIPJ contracture.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",22357334,2012
A three-digit dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease.,"In patients presenting to our unit with recurrent or aggressive Dupuytren's disease (DD), we favour the technique of radical excision and resurfacing popularised by Logan, who has described its use for the ulnar two digits of the hand at the same operation.(1) In patients in whom dermofasciectomy may be indicated in three or more digits, we have previously advised patients that the quality of the surgical attention and the post-operative physiotherapy might be better delivered by a staged approach. However, we demonstrate here with a case report that the technique can have excellent outcome when used for three digits at the same time. We are unaware of similar previous reports.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,22351544,2012
MMP-14 and MMP-2 are key metalloproteases in Dupuytren's disease fibroblast-mediated contraction.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibrotic condition of the palmar fascia, leading to deposition of collagen-rich cords and progressive flexion of the fingers. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are poorly understood. We have previously shown altered expression of extracellular matrix-degrading proteases (matrix metalloproteases, MMPs, and 'a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin motifs', ADAMTS, proteases) in palmar fascia from DD patients compared to control and shown that the expression of a sub-set of these genes correlates with post-operative outcome. In the current study we used an in vitro model of collagen contraction to identify the specific proteases which mediate this effect. We measured the expression of all MMPs, ADAMTSs and their inhibitors in fibroblasts derived from the palmar fascia of DD patients, both in monolayer culture and in the fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL) model of cell-mediated contraction. Key proteases, previously identified in our tissue studies, were expressed in vitro and regulated by tension in the FPCL, including MMP1, 2, 3, 13 and 14. Knockdown of MMP2 and MMP14 (but not MMP1, 3 and 13) inhibited cell-mediated contraction, and knockdown of MMP14 inhibited proMMP-2 activation. Interestingly, whilst collagen is degraded during the FPCL assay, this is not altered upon knockdown of any of the proteases examined. We conclude that MMP-14 (via its ability to activate proMMP-2) and MMP-2 are key proteases in collagen contraction mediated by fibroblasts in DD patients. These proteases may be drug targets or act as biomarkers for disease progression.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,22342364,2012
A pilot study assessing the effectiveness of postoperative splinting after limited fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease.,"Before surgery for Dupuytren's contracture, 54 patients with a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion contractures of at least 30° were randomized to receive either a 3-month splinting protocol together with hand therapy under the direct supervision of hand therapists, or the same hand therapy alone. Extension deficit of the PIP joint (primary outcome measure), global perceived effect, pain intensity, comfort and complications were assessed at baseline and 1 year after surgery. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to splint-plus-hand therapy had a mean reduction of 21° in flexion contracture after 1 year, compared with 29° in the group receiving hand therapy alone (p = 0.1). There was no difference between the groups regarding other parameters. After operative release of a Dupuytren's contracture, a postoperative protocol using a splint and hand therapy was no better than hand therapy alone in minimizing postoperative flexion contractures.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",22311918,2012

Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a benign contractile disorder of the hand. The condition commonly affects older men of Celtic descent. Although fibroproliferation and collagen alteration play a role in its etiology, defining a cause remains elusive. Nonoperative intervention for advanced disease has shown only short-term benefit. Therefore, open fasciectomy has become the mainstay of treatment. Associated morbidity and recurrence have prompted investigation into less invasive techniques, including needle aponeurotomy and enzymatic fasciotomy. Data from phase III studies using injectable collagenase are changing treatment algorithms. Postoperative rehabilitation includes nighttime splinting and immediate active range of motion exercises to facilitate return to function.",Orthopedics,22229922,2012
"Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum. Short-term benefit in Dupuytren's contracture, unknown long-term risks.","Dupuytren's contracture is due to fibroblast overgrowth in the aponeuroses of the hand and fingers, leading to excessive collagen production. This can cause functional impairment due to retraction of one or several fingers.The standard treatment is surgery, but relapses are frequent. A product containing collagenolytic bacterial enzymes (collagenases) is now marketed for local treatment of these retractions. Two double-blind placebo-controlled trials in 308 and 66 patients show that 1 to 3 local injections at one-month intervals lead to near-total reduction in finger retraction in about 50% of cases, versus about 5% of cases after placebo injections. A non-comparative follow-up of 830 successfully treated patients, lasting an average of 7.4 months, showed a relapse rate of 4%. The Most patients experience local reactions such as swelling, bruising, bleeding and pain. These reactions were rarely severe in clinical trials (1% of patients), but cases of tendon rupture have been described. Nearly all treated patients develop anticollagenase antibodies. The only known consequence of this immune reaction is pruritus, reported by about 11% of patients participating in clinical trials. The possible impact of these antibodies on the efficacy of subsequent injections is not known. A certain antigenic kinship between the bacterial collagenases and certain human enzymes raises the possibility of long-term autoimmune reactions. In practice, the limitations of surgical management and the simplicity of local collagenase injections make it a valid option for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Uncertainties concerning the long-term harm-benefit balance mean that this treatment should only be considered when surgery is not an option.",Prescrire international,22216538,2012
"Heavy manual work, exposure to vibration and Dupuytren's disease? Results of a surveillance program for musculoskeletal disorders.","INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease in men and its relationship with work exposure, particularly heavy manual work with and without significant use of vibrating tools, using data from a surveillance program for musculoskeletal disorders.METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in France between 2002 and 2005. Dupuytren's disease was diagnosed clinically by one of 83 occupational physicians. Exposure in relation to work status and occupational risk factors was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire, and categorised according to vibration exposure (defined as use of vibrating tools for ≥2 h/day), heavy manual work without vibration exposure (defined as use of hand tools for ≥2 h/day (use of vibrating tools for ≥2 h/day excluded) and Borg scale ≥15/20) and no such exposure. Bivariate and multivariate associations using logistic models were recorded in men and in those with &gt;10 years in the same job.RESULTS: Of 2161 men, 1.3% (n=27) had Dupuytren's disease (mean age 47.1±6.7 years). Heavy manual work without vibration exposure was significantly associated with the condition (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 11.5) adjusted on age and diabetes), as was use of vibrating tools (aOR 5.1; 2.1 to 12.2). These associations remained significant among subjects with &gt;10 years in the same job, with increases in aOR of 6.1 (1.5 to 25.0) and 10.7 (3.4 to 34.6), respectively.CONCLUSION: Despite the limited number of cases, occupational exposure, including both vibration exposure and heavy manual work without significant vibration exposure, was associated with Dupuytren's disease.",Occupational and environmental medicine,22213840,2012
[An attempt to objectify the assessment of extension or recurrence of Dupuytren's disease on the basis of ultrasound].,"Dupuytren's contracture is a disease of unknown etiology, leading with time to decreased hand function caused by increasing contracture of fingers. Excision of contracted longitudinal palmar fascia constitutes the most important way of treatment. Due to fact that disease has progressive course in many patients recurrence (i.e. overgrowth of longitudinal palmar aponeurosis apart from the operated site) or extension (i.e. similar process affecting formerly operated site) occurs. An attempt to objectify the assessment of recurrence or extension of Dupuytren's disease on the basis of sonographic examination of palmar surface of the hand during distant (at least 24 months from surgery) followup constituted the aim of the study. 41 patients operated on from January 2000 to February 2009 in 2nd Department of General Surgery in Krakow due to Dupuytren's contracture constituted the study material. Mean age of the patients reached 62,78 years (SD +/- 9,32), and mean follow up time 5,74 years (SD +/- 2,90). Sonographic assessment was performed in 26 operated on left hands and 24 right hands. 9 patients had both hands operated on. In most of the patients during surgery the contralateral hand was also affected by the disease. Extension of Dupuytren's disease was found in 11 hands, recurrence--in 18 hands, while concurrent extension and recurrence was found in 17 hands. Extension usually was found on the radial side and affected mainly I interphalangeal space followed by disease affecting I and III ray of the hand. In one patient 2 independent foci of the disease were found within I interphalangeal space. Recurrences affected mainly ulnar side of the hand: V and IV rays of the hand. Concurrently found extension and recurrence affected 2 or 3 rays. In the cases of 3 rays affected extension dominated (2 rays vs. 1 ray of recurrence). On sonographic assessment mean diameters of lesions during distant follow- up were 12,69 x 4,62 x 3,95 [mm] with recurrent lesions being larger than mean values found in extensions. With partial fasciectomy being the most commonly performed operation in cases of Dupuytren's disease ultrasound can constitute very important technique of assessment of exacerbation of the lesions of palmar aponeurosis allowing for the choice of appropriate surgical technique for particular case, detection of postoperative extension and/or recurrence and for the cases clinically doubtful.",Przeglad lekarski,23750436,2012
Concurrent inhibition of TGF-β and mitogen driven signaling cascades in Dupuytren's disease - non-surgical treatment strategies from a signaling point of view.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign progressive fibro-proliferative disorder of the fascia palmaris of the hand. Currently, treatment consists of surgical excision with a relatively high recurrence rate and risk of complications. To improve long-term outcome of DD treatment, research focus has shifted towards molecular targets for DD as an alternative to surgery. Therefore, complete and exact understanding of the cause of DD is needed. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is considered a key player in DD. We recently showed that increased TGF-β expression in DD correlates not only with elevated expression and activation of downstream Smad effectors, but also with overactive ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling. Both TGF-β/Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways increase expression of key fibrotic markers and contractility of Dupuytren's myofibroblasts. What is not yet known is whether these two signaling cascades each accelerate DD autonomously, successively or in conjunction. Elucidation of this mechanism will help develop new potential non-surgical treatments. We hypothesize that TGF-β-induced short-term activation of the MAPK pathway leads to an autonomous non-Smad driven fibrosis. Therefore, successful treatment strategies will target not only TGF-β/Smad, but also intracellular MAPK signaling. In this review we discuss possible scenarios in which such a drift from TGF-β induced Smad signaling to autonomous non-Smad signaling could be observed in DD. The potential therapeutic effects of small cytokine signaling cascades inhibitors, such as TGF-β type I receptor-, (pan-) tyrosine- or ERK1/2 MAP-kinase inhibitor will be highlighted. To abrogate the fibrotic trait and the recurrence of DD, we speculate on sequential and co-application of such molecules in order to provide possible new non-operative strategies for DD.",Medical hypotheses,22196988,2011
DNA copy number variations at chromosome 7p14.1 and chromosome 14q11.2 are associated with dupuytren's disease: potential role for MMP and Wnt signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a common fibroproliferative disorder with an unknown etiology. Emerging evidence suggests a strong genetic component involved in the manifestation of the disease. This study aims to investigate the potential involvement of copy number variations in Dupuytren's disease pathogenesis.METHODS: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (NimbleGen Human CGH 2.1 M) was utilized to compare DNA from (1) nodules versus internal control (patient's blood; n = 4) and (2) nodules (n = 4) versus external control (commercial reference DNA pooled from 10 donors). Analysis was carried out using Nexus 5.1 (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, Calif.) with the inclusion of additional results from previously published array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Copy number variations were considered to be common in Dupuytren's disease if the overlap was statistically significant and they were present in the majority (75 to 87.5 percent when compared with controls) of Dupuytren's disease nodules. The copy number variations loci were also compared with recently published genome wide-association studies. Common copy number variations were further validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. DNA from 25 Dupuytren's disease cases and 30 external controls were used in the quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation. In addition, gene expression was compared between Dupuytren's disease nodules and internal controls (transverse palmar fascia; n = 7).RESULTS: Five common copy number variations, on chromosome 17q12, 1p31.1, 20p13, 7p14.1, and 14q11.2, were identified by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Significantly higher copy numbers of copy number variations at chromosome 7p14.1 and 14q11.2 in Dupuytren's disease were confirmed in quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation. Matrix metalloproteinase-14 and secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (near a polymorphism recently associated with Dupuytren's disease) were significantly up-regulated in nodules.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an association between Dupuytren's disease and copy number variations at chromosomes 7p14.1 and 14q11.2.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,22183494,2011

[Plantar fibromatosis and Dupuytren's contracture in an adolescent].,"BACKGROUND: Fibromatosis represents a wide group of benign, locally proliferative disorders of fibroblasts. Dupuytren's disease is a benign proliferative disease of palmar aponeurosis which usually affects adults between 40 and 60 years of age. Ledderhose's disease or plantar fibromatosis is plantar equivalent of Dupuyten's disease most often affecting middle-aged and older men, usually bilateral, represented with painless nodule in the medial division of plantar fascia.CASE REPORT: We presented a 19-year old adolescent that turned to a plastic surgeon complaining to his small finger contracture. He noticed palmar thickening with nodule over the metacarpophalangeal joint of small finger of his right hand when he was 16 years old. A year later a finger started to band. During physical checkup we noticed plantar nodule that also had his father and grandmother. Magnetic resonance and tumor biopsy confirmed a suspicion on plantar fibromatosis - Ledderhose's disease. Clinical exam of the hand clearly led to a conclusion that the patient had Dupuytren's contracture with pretendinous cord over the small finger flexor tendons and lack of extension of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. On the extensor side of the PIP joints there were Garrod's nodes. The patient refused surgical treatment of plantar tumor, but agreed to surgical correction of finger contracture.CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that Dupuytren's disease and plantar fibromatosis are diseases of adults, the possibility of conjoint appearance of these forms of fibromatosis in adolescent period of life should be kept in mind especially in patients with strong genetic predisposition.",Vojnosanitetski pregled,22165757,2011
Needle aponeurotomy: a treatment alternative for Dupuytren's disease.,"Since the publication of Baron Dupuytren's first paper 180 years ago, the treatment of Dupuytren's disease continues to be problematic. Because of the high recurrence rate following surgery, there has been a shift to more radical surgical options. Unfortunately, this has led to more frequent and sometimes serious postoperative complications. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the original treatment for Dupuytren's disease: simple fasciotomy of the diseased cord. One method of fasciotomy is needle aponeurotomy, which can be done in the office as an outpatient with local anesthesia.

Dupuytren disease: an evolving understanding of an age-old disease.,"Dupuytren disease, a clinical entity originally described more than 400 years ago, is a progressive disease of genetic origin. Excessive myofibroblast proliferation and altered collagen matrix composition lead to thickened and contracted palmar fascia; the resultant digital flexion contractures may severely limit function. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and remains a topic of research and debate. Genetic predisposition, trauma, inflammatory response, ischemia, and environment, as well as variable expression of proteins and growth factors within the local tissue, all play a role in the disease process. Common treatments of severe disease include open fasciectomy or fasciotomy. These procedures may be complicated by the complex anatomic relationships between cords (pathologic contracted fascia) and adjacent neurovascular structures. Recent advances in the management of Dupuytren disease involve less invasive treatments, such as percutaneous needle fasciotomy and injectable collagenase Clostridium histolyticum. Postoperative management focuses on minimizing the cellular response of cord disruption and maximizing range of motion through static or dynamic extension splinting.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,22134207,2011

Dupuytren's disease in the Hispanic population: a 10-year retrospective review.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a common benign fibroproliferative disorder of the hand. Epidemiologic studies have reported significant variation in disease prevalence among races, focusing primarily on those of northern European descent. In contrast, Dupuytren's disease in the Hispanic population has received little attention. Thus, in this study, the authors aimed to determine the prevalence and operative rate of Dupuytren's disease in the Hispanic, black, white, Asian, Native American, and other races and to characterize the disease presentation in Hispanics who required surgical treatment.METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted to identify the racial distribution of Dupuytren's disease patients seen at Bellevue Hospital between July of 2000 and August of 2010. In Hispanic patients requiring surgical treatment for their disease, data were collected on the following parameters: age, sex, ethnicity, hand dominance, hand affected, and digits operated on. Epidemiologic factors including smoking, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, epilepsy, and hypertension were also evaluated.RESULTS: Dupuytren's disease prevalence was found to be 533 per 100,000 in Hispanics. Of these patients, 1.8 percent required surgical treatment, and this group was characterized by the following comorbidities: smoking (57.1 percent), hypertension (57.1 percent), alcoholism (52.4 percent), diabetes mellitus (47.6 percent), and hypercholesterolemia (19.0 percent).CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results indicate that Dupuytren's disease is more prevalent in the Hispanic population than previously reported. Although the epidemiologic factors identified in Hispanics with Dupuytren's disease are similar to those in other races investigated, there are important differences with respect to clinical presentation and surgical treatment.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,22094744,2011
Five-year results of a randomized clinical trial on treatment in Dupuytren's disease: percutaneous needle fasciotomy versus limited fasciectomy.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing number of methods for treating Dupuytren's disease indicates a need for comparative studies. In this article, the 5-year follow-up results of a randomized controlled study that compared percutaneous needle fasciotomy and limited fasciectomy are presented.METHODS: One hundred eleven patients with 115 affected hands with a minimal passive extension deficit of 30 degrees were assigned randomly to the two groups. Follow-up examinations were performed at 1 and 6 weeks; 6 months; and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. Outcome parameters were total passive extension deficit, patient satisfaction, flexion, and sensibility. Furthermore, disease extension was recorded. The primary endpoint was recurrence, defined as an increase of total passive extension deficit of greater than 30 degrees. Ninety-three patients reached this endpoint.RESULTS: The recurrence rate after 5 years in the needle fasciotomy group (84.9 percent) was significantly higher than in the limited fasciectomy group (20.9 percent) (p &lt; 0.001), and occurred significantly sooner in the needle fasciotomy group (p = 0.001). Older age at the time of treatment decreased the recurrence rate (p = 0.005). No other diathesis characteristics influenced recurrence. Patient satisfaction was high in both groups but was significantly higher in the limited fasciectomy group. Nevertheless, many patients (53 percent) preferred percutaneous needle fasciotomy in case of recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is the preferred treatment for elderly patients with Dupuytren's disease and for those willing to accept a possible early recurrence in the context of the advantages, such as fast recovery, a low complication rate, and minimal invasiveness.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,21987045,2011
"Cost-effectiveness of open partial fasciectomy, needle aponeurotomy, and collagenase injection for dupuytren contracture.","PURPOSE: We undertook a cost-utility analysis to compare traditional fasciectomy for Dupuytren with 2 new treatments, needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injection.METHODS: We constructed an expected-value decision analysis model with an arm representing each treatment. A survey was administered to a cohort of 50 consecutive subjects to determine utilities of different interventions. We conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of varying the rate of disease recurrence in each arm of the analysis as well as the cost of the collagenase injection. The threshold for a cost-effective treatment is based on the traditional willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained.RESULTS: The cost of open partial fasciectomy was $820,114 per QALY gained over no treatment. The cost of needle aponeurotomy was $96,474 per QALY gained versus no treatment. When we performed a sensitivity analysis and set the success rate at 100%, the cost of needle aponeurotomy was $49,631. When needle aponeurotomy was performed without surgical center or anesthesia costs and with reduced hand therapy, the cost was $36,570. When a complete collagenase injection series was priced at $250, the cost was $31,856 per QALY gained. When the injection series was priced at $945, the cost was $49,995 per QALY gained. At the market price of $5,400 per injection, the cost was $166,268 per QALY gained.CONCLUSIONS: In the current model, open partial fasciectomy is not cost-effective. Needle aponeurotomy is cost-effective if the success rate is high. Collagenase injection is cost-effective when priced under $945.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis II.",The Journal of hand surgery,21981831,2011
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is a novel treatment for Dupuytren's contracture, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2010. Prior to its availability, surgery was the only treatment for contracture related to this disorder. Dupuytren's disease is a benign, progressive fibroproliferative disorder affecting the palms of the hands. It is characterized by the formation of collagen- rich nodules and cords, which gradually shorten by the action of myofibroblasts, resulting in finger contractures. Intralesional use of clostridial collagenase has been evaluated in a total of 1,082 patients receiving 2,630 injections during its clinical development, including 2 large prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials: Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren's I (CORD I) and CORD II. Both studies showed a statistically significant reduction in contracture compared to placebo and treatment was well-tolerated with the majority of adverse events self-limited. Serious adverse events related to collagenase activity were rare. Maximal improvement was seen in patients with less severe contractures and with contractures of the metacarpophalangeal joint. This first-in-class biologic, injectable clostridial collagenase histolyticum, provides a safe, effective alternative to surgery for patients with Dupuytren's contracture.","Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",21971540,2011
"Determining clinically important changes in range of motion in patients with Dupuytren's Contracture: secondary analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CORD I study.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Injectable collagenase Clostridium histolyticum is efficacious in correcting Dupuytren's contracture as assessed by changes in the angle of contracture and range of motion (ROM). However, clinically important changes in ROM have not been evaluated in depth. The objective of this secondary analysis of the CORD I trial was to identify severity levels using baseline ROM, estimate a clinically important difference (CID) for ROM, and link the results to collagenase treatment and patient satisfaction.METHODS: In the CORD I trial, patients with Dupuytren's disease and joint contractures ≥20° were randomized to receive a maximum of three collagenase 0.58 mg or placebo injections into the cord of the affected hand at 30-day intervals. The primary endpoint was reduction in contracture to ≤5° 30 days after the last injection (day 30). The secondary endpoints, which are reported in this analysis, were ROM, physician- and patient-rated severity ('normal', 'mild', 'moderate', 'severe') and improvement, and treatment satisfaction. Linear regression was used to model data for severity classification and CID estimation for ROM based on physician and patient ratings.RESULTS: At baseline, mean ROM was 43.9° in the collagenase-treated joints (n = 197) and 45.3° in the placebo-treated joints (n = 102). On day 30, mean ROM was 80.7° in the collagenase-treated joints and 49.5° in the placebo-treated joints. The mean increase in ROM was 36.7° in the collagenase-treated joints (p &lt; 0.001) and 4.0° in the placebo-treated joints (not significant). The estimated CID for ROM was 13.5° (95% CI 11.9, 15.1), reflecting a one-category change in severity. The mean increase in ROM exceeded the CID in the collagenase-treated joints but not in the placebo-treated joints; the difference between collagenase treatment and placebo in the mean increase in ROM also exceeded the CID, implying that the improvement with collagenase was clinically relevant. The severity classification for ROM was: ≥67.0° ('normal'), ≥54.3 and &lt;67.0° ('mild'), ≥41.6 and &lt;54.3° ('moderate'), and &lt;41.6° ('severe'). More collagenase- than placebo-treated patients achieved 'normal' (81% vs 25%; p &lt; 0.0001) status, and more collagenase- than placebo-treated patients reported being 'very/quite satisfied' (87% vs 32%; p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: Injectable collagenase significantly improves ROM and treatment satisfaction versus placebo. ROM improvements are clinically relevant as well as statistically significant. These data support the potential need to include ROM and physician- and patient-rated severity and satisfaction as standard assessments for Dupuytren's contracture treatment outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00528606; other study identification number: AUX-CC-857 (Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.).",Clinical drug investigation,21967070,2011
Nonoperative treatment of PIPJ flexion contractures associated with Dupuytren's disease.,"Post-surgical outcomes in patients with Dupuytren's disease causing flexion contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint can be inconsistent and are often associated with protracted rehabilitation, reduced flexion, recurrence of the contracture, and patient dissatisfaction. An alternative treatment option, comprised of splinting and soft tissue mobilization techniques, was introduced to stabilize early contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint in the hopes of delaying or obviating surgery. Over the course of approximately 12.6 months (± 7.8), thirteen patients were followed at the hand clinic at Hotel Dieu Hospital in Kingston. One patient was unable to complete the course of therapy. Of the remaining patients, analysis showed significant improvement in active proximal interphalangeal joint extension of approximately 14.6° (SD: ± 5.1°; range: 5-25°) over the course of the treatment (p &lt; .05). Nighttime static extension splinting and soft tissue mobilization techniques appear to delay and possibly prevent the need for surgery in individuals with flexion contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint due to Dupuytren's disease.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",21965179,2011
Epidemiogenetic study of French families with Paget's disease of bone.,"OBJECTIVE: To search for association with environmental factors and to determine SQSTM1/p62 mutations prevalence in French families with Paget's disease of bone (PDB).METHODS: Unrelated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PDB were recruited in three Rheumatology departments and informed consent obtained. First- and second-degree relatives of each index case had a physical examination, blood taken for DNA extraction and biochemical measurements, and a whole-body bone scan. Exons 7 and 8 and exon-intron boundaries of SQSTM1/p62 (p62) gene were PCR-amplified before sequencing. Haplotype carriers of the p62(P392L) mutation were determined. Comparisons between PDB patients and healthy relatives were performed.RESULTS: We investigated 18 families consisting of 83 individuals: 20 patients with known PDB, three relatives with newly-diagnosed PDB and 60 healthy relatives. Index cases and/or relatives with Dupuytren's disease were found in eight (44.4%) out of the 18 families. Forty-three percent of PDB patients were former or current tobacco users versus 18% of healthy relatives (P=0.02; OR=3.37 (1.04-11.09)). Five index cases (27.8%) were carriers of SQSTM1/p62 mutations: three p62(P392L) mutations, one p62(P392L/A390X) double mutation and one p62(A390X) mutation. The p62(P392L) mutation was carried by haplotype 2 in all four index cases.CONCLUSION: Accurate phenotypic assessment of PDB patients' relatives allowed for diagnosing PDB in three asymptomatic relatives. There was evidence for an aggregation of Dupuytren's disease in PDB families (not associated with SQSTM1/p62 mutation), and for an association between PDB and tobacco use. Half of PDB familial forms carried a SQSTM1/p62 mutation, p62(P392L) mutation being the most frequent.","Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",21962384,2011
Dupuytren's: a systems biology disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is an ill-defined fibroproliferative disorder of the palm of the hands leading to digital contracture. DD commonly occurs in individuals of northern European extraction. Cellular components and processes associated with DD pathogenesis include altered gene and protein expression of cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components. Histology has shown increased but varying levels of particular types of collagen, myofibroblasts and myoglobin proteins in DD tissue. Free radicals and localised ischaemia have been suggested to trigger the proliferation of DD tissue. Although the existing available biological information on DD may contain potentially valuable (though largely uninterpreted) information, the precise aetiology of DD remains unknown. Systems biology combines mechanistic modelling with quantitative experimentation in studies of networks and better understanding of the interaction of multiple components in disease processes. Adopting systems biology may be the ideal approach for future research in order to improve understanding of complex diseases of multifactorial origin. In this review, we propose that DD is a disease of several networks rather than of a single gene, and show that this accounts for the experimental observations obtained to date from a variety of sources. We outline how DD may be investigated more effectively by employing a systems biology approach that considers the disease network as a whole rather than focusing on any specific single molecule.",Arthritis research &amp; therapy,21943049,2011

Due to our own experience and a brief review of the literature we recommend percutanous needle fasciotomy for patients who can't get surgery because of restricted general conditions. Furthermore the PNF is also useful in younger patients with a well defined visible and palpable cord which is responsible for flexion contracture of MP joint to avoid or delay the operation.,"Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",21935845,2011
[Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by means of injectable collagenase: first clinical experiences].,"Recently a minimal invasive therapeutic option by means of enzymatic lysis of Dupuytren's cord was introduced in Europe under the name Xiapex® (Pfizer, Germany).Here we present our first experiences in clinical application with special remarks on complications.In this study 16 injections on 12 Dupuytren's cords in 8 patients were conducted. The average age of the patients was 62.5 (48-74) years. Constitution and application were carried out according to the manufacturer's guidelines. If both the metacarpophalangeal (MP)- and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint were affected, injections were carried out on different points in time. 5 injections were done for contracture of the MPjoint, 4 injections for the PIPjoint, and 3 injections of both, the MP- and PIPjoint. Before the treatment and after 2 weeks the contracture of the treated joint was measured with use of a goniometer for small joints. Side effects and complications were documented as well as whether patients needed - and if yes, for how many days - a pain medication.Total flexion contracture of treated joints could be significantly reduced from 103°±12° to 37°±9°. In MPjoints the flexion contracture was reduced from 47°±8° to 14°±5° and in PIPjoints from 69°±10° to 37°±11° (p&lt;0.05). 5 treated cords showed no signs of complication, recorded local adverse effects were edema (n=5), erythema (n=4) and tearing of skin (n=2). 6 patients needed pain medication for a maximum of 4 days.Treatment with collagenase appears to be an effective and safe therapeutic option for selective cases. Though the procedure ostensibly seems easy, one must emphasize the need for the appropriate application performed only by professionals with a high level of experience both in anatomical knowledge as well as hand surgical know-how to cope potential complications. The value of the new method in relation to the standard partial aponeurectomy and percutaneous needle fasciotomy needs to be ascertained by further research in order to establish a clear indication for each method of treatment.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",21935844,2011
[Collagenase Clostridum histolyticum in the management of Dupuytren's contracture].,"Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferate disease of the palmar aponeurosis with a formation of nodules and cords. Surgical treatment is the gold standard for Dupuytren's contracture at the moment. A short while ago Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was licensed as a non-surgical method to treat Dupuytren's contracture. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is injected directly into the Dupuytren's cord and after 24 h the contracture is distended by manual rupturing. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum causes a depletion of collagen, however neurovascular structures are spared. 2 clinical phase III studies showed that contractures could be effectively reduced when using Collagenase clostridium histolyticum. However, there are no long-term results regarding effectiveness and side effects, or comparative studies using surgical methods. This paper presents a review of Collagenase clostridium histolyticum and its role in the management of Dupuytren's contracture. Indication, technical procedure, treatment results and complications are described.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",21935843,2011
Prevalence and pattern of hand soft-tissue changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Hand soft-tissue changes are well described in patients with T1DM, but not in T2DM patients. For this reason, this study aimed at examining the prevalence and pattern of hand soft-tissue changes in patients with T2DM.METHODS: A total of 206 consecutive patients with T2DM and 203 age-, gender- and occupation-matched healthy controls were examined by two individual observers, and then underwent the appropriate investigations.RESULTS: The 132 (64%) patients with T2DM included 187 hands compared with 96 (23.6%) healthy controls including 133 hands (P=0.01 for both). Dupuytren's contracture (DC) (42 vs. 29.3%, respectively; P=0.01), limited joint mobility (LJM) (39 vs. 28.5%, respectively; P=0.01) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (5.3 vs. 1%, respectively; P=0.01) were significantly higher in T2DM patients than in the controls, but not stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (FTS, 'trigger finger'). Indeed, none of the patients or controls had FTS. In patients with T2DM, DC showed a radial shift, and was more horizontal and severe than in the controls. These hand soft-tissue changes correlated significantly with age (P=0.0001), duration of diabetes (P=0.001) and the presence of microangiopathy (P=0.001).CONCLUSION: Hand changes are more prevalent and severe in patients with T2DM, and are correlated with age, duration of diabetes and microvascular complications.",Diabetes &amp; metabolism,21917496,2011
Prevalence of rheumatic conditions in patients with diabetes mellitus in a tertiary care hospital.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are common in diabetic subjects. The pathophysiology of these disorders in diabetic patients is not obvious. It could be due to connective tissue disorders, glycosylated end products, vasculopathy, neuropathy or combinations. A wide range of musculoskeletal syndromes have been described in association with diabetes, namely diabetic cheiro-arthropathy, adhesive capsulitis of shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's contracture, hyperostosis, osteo-arthritis, hyperuricaemia, etc. This study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of these conditions in diabetes mellitus and to look for any associations with diabetic complications or therapy. A tertiary care centre-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 100 consecutive diabetic patients (WHO criteria) attending medicine department who were enrolled. The study was done at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, from March 2008 to February 2009. The diagnoses of the rheumatic conditions were made by unbiased clinical observations on the basis of standardised case definitions or criteria. Limited joint mobility (29%), adhesive capsulitis (18%), and osteo-arthritis of knee (27%) or hand (17%) were the most common rheumatic conditions in diabetics. Trigger finger (flexor tenosynovitis) and carpal tunnel syndrome were also present in 7% and 5% cases of diabetics respectively. Although hyperuricaemia was present in 9%, clinical gout was present in only 4%. There was no clear association of these syndromes with diabetic renal disease or micro-albuminuria. Most of these conditions were noted in chronic long duration diabetic subjects.",Journal of the Indian Medical Association,21888166,2011
Diabetic hand syndromes as a clinical and diagnostic tool for diabetes mellitus patients.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia with various complications including diabetic hand syndrome (DHS); a condition characterized by association of distinct entities; limited joint mobility (LJM), Dupuytren's disease (DD), flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these changes and their association to diabetes duration. We studied 142 type 2 and 45 type 1 DM patients and investigated the presence of these hand changes and peripheral neuropathy (PNP). The prevalence of LJM was 29.4%, DD was 17.6%, FTS was 10.7% and CTS 41.7% in all diabetics. The prevalence of CTS was more in type 2 DM (83.3%) as compared to type 1 DM (24.4%). Age and duration of diabetes were clearly related to these changes. A clear association between these changes and PNP was observed. The prevalence of CTS and hand changes was higher in type 2 diabetics. The association of DD and PNP suggests that common factors could contribute to their pathogenesis. Consequently, clinical examination for diabetic hand should not ignore it.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,21831469,2011
[The importance of rehabilitation after operative treatment of Dupuytren's disease].,"Postoperative hand therapy in patients after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture is common in medical practice. Through an effective splinting and exercise program, the surgical outcome can be enhanced. The treatment plan must take into account the wide range of reactions to surgery. The management plan must be flexible, more than in most areas of hand surgery. The most important points in hand therapy after surgery for Dupuytren's disease include: 1) early detection of potential postoperative complications--including disturbances in wound healing; 2) edema control; 3) scar management; 4) maintenance of surgical correction; 5) restoration of finger flexion to the degree of preoperative range of motion. The postoperative program of hand rehabilitation depends on type of surgery, and therapist's education. The hand therapist should see all patients initially on removal of the operative dressing and provide advice on a program of active mobilization. Thereafter, patients should be seen routinely at weekly intervals to ensure that recovery of motion is progressing.","Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",21812360,2011
Genetics of Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a progressive fibrosis of the palmar fascia characterized by the formation of a nodule, which evolves into a cord. DD is the most common hereditary disease of the connective tissue preferentially affecting Caucasoids originating from Northern Europe. Some environmental factors are associated with DD, namely alcohol consumption, tobacco exposure and, possibly, manual activities. Diabetes and epilepsy are the most frequently reported DD-associated diseases. The genetic mode of inheritance is not well understood, but seems to be heterogeneous: most frequently, autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, and rarely recessive autosomal or maternal (matrilinear), suggesting a mitochondrial heredity. Initially, a suggestion of linkage with the DUPC1 locus at 16q was proposed. Then, among the genomic variations observed in DD, alterations in the copy number of genes in chromosomal regions 10q22, 16p12.1 and 17p12, associations with the HLA-DRB1*15 allele and a mutation in the rRNA 16s identified in forms with a matrilinear heredity, were reported. Finally, a genome-wide study has shown a genetic association of DD with 6, 11 and 16 chromosomes. Pathophysiology of DD involves mainly myofibroblasts and the extracellular matrix of collagen. Gene and protein expression studies have confirmed the central role of the β catenin of the TGFβ pathways in the pathogenesis of DD.","Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",21803632,2011
Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scale: development and validation of a tool to assess Dupuytren's disease-specific disability.,"OBJECTIVE: To our knowledge, no functional outcome measure has been developed and validated for Dupuytren's disease. We aimed to develop and validate a patient-reported functional outcome measure for Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: Patients with Dupuytren's disease (n = 9) and medical experts (n = 7) provided input and opinions about limiting activities that were difficult to perform because of Dupuytren's disease for item generation. The provisional scale was studied in an independent sample of patients (n = 85) for item reduction according to response distribution, reliability, redundancy, and loading in a 1-factor solution. The final scale was evaluated as follows: reliability using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient from the previous 85-patient population, and construct validity and responsiveness after needle aponeurotomy in another independent 53-patient sample. For construct validity, convergent validity and divergent validity were tested. The clinically important change was estimated relative to a 1-point categorical change on the Tubiana scale.RESULTS: A 52-item provisional scale was generated and reduced to the final 9-item scale called the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scale (total score 0-45). The scale showed good to excellent reliability and suitable construct validity. The URAM score improved after needle aponeurotomy: the standardized effect size was 0.56. The estimated clinically important change of the URAM scale was 2.9 points.CONCLUSION: We provide the first patient-reported functional measure for Dupuytren's disease. The URAM scale demonstrated suitable psychometric properties, and is short and convenient enough for easy use in daily practice and in clinical studies.",Arthritis care &amp; research,21786431,2011
Preliminary soft-tissue distraction versus checkrein ligament release after fasciectomy in the treatment of dupuytren proximal interphalangeal joint contractures.,"BACKGROUND: Checkrein ligament release for treatment of proximal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren contractures does not address the shortened arteries or deficient skin. The Digit Widget uses soft-tissue distraction to overcome these issues. This study compares checkrein ligament release after fasciectomy versus preliminary soft-tissue distraction, followed by operative release, for treatment of proximal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren contractures.METHODS: The authors compared operative and postoperative characteristics of patients treated with either fasciectomy plus checkrein ligament release or Digit Widget distraction between 2001 and 2008. Seventeen patients (20 digits) underwent ligament release (mean contracture, 55.9 degrees); six of these 20 were reoperations. Thirteen patients (17 digits) underwent distraction (mean contracture, 67.6 degrees); 10 of 17 were reoperations.RESULTS: The 20 digits treated with fasciectomy plus ligament release had an average extension improvement of 31.4 degrees (range, -4 to 70 degrees). Digits treated with distraction had an average extension improvement of 53.4 degrees (range, 30 to 75 degrees) (p&lt;0.001 versus ligament release). Three digits treated with distraction improved to full proximal interphalangeal extension. Initial contractures of 60 degrees or less treated by ligament release (n=12) or distraction (n=7) improved by means of 28.8 degrees and 47.7 degrees, respectively (p=0.048). Contractures greater than 60 degrees treated by ligament release (n=8) or distraction (n=10) improved by means of 35.3 degrees and 57.3 degrees, respectively (p=0.02).CONCLUSION: Soft-tissue distraction followed by operative release showed greater correction than Dupuytren fasciectomy plus checkrein ligament release.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,21738085,2011
Wnt signaling and Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibromatosis of the hands and fingers that leads to flexion contractures. We hypothesized that multiple genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to this disease and sought to identify susceptibility genes to better understand its pathogenesis.METHODS: We conducted a genomewide association study of 960 Dutch persons with Dupuytren's disease and 3117 controls (the discovery set) to test for association between the disease and genetic markers. We tested the 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) most strongly associated with Dupuytren's disease (P&lt;1×10(-4)) in the discovery set in three additional, independent case series comprising a total of 1365 affected persons and 8445 controls from Germany, the United Kingdom, and The Netherlands.RESULTS: Initially, we observed a significant genomewide association between Dupuytren's disease and 8 SNPs at three loci. Tests of replication and joint analysis of all data from 2325 patients with Dupuytren's disease and 11,562 controls yielded an association with 11 SNPs from nine different loci (P&lt;5.0×10(-8)). Six of these loci contain genes known to be involved in the Wnt-signaling pathway: WNT4 (rs7524102) (P=2.8×10(-9); odds ratio, 1.28), SFRP4 (rs16879765) (P=5.6×10(-39); odds ratio, 1.98), WNT2 (rs4730775) (P=3.0×10(-8); odds ratio, 0.83), RSPO2 (rs611744) (P=7.9×10(-15); odds ratio, 0.75), SULF1 (rs2912522) (P=2.0×10(-13); odds ratio, 0.72), and WNT7B (rs6519955) (P=3.2×10(-33); odds ratio, 1.54).CONCLUSIONS: This study implicates nine different loci involved in genetic susceptibility to Dupuytren's disease. The fact that six of these nine loci harbor genes encoding proteins in the Wnt-signaling pathway suggests that aberrations in this pathway are key to the process of fibromatosis in Dupuytren's disease.",The New England journal of medicine,21732829,2011

Extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy and lipografting: a new treatment for Dupuytren disease.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of Dupuytren contracture is fraught with morbidity and prolonged recovery. This article introduces a novel minimally invasive alternative for Dupuytren disease and its outcome.METHODS: The procedure consists of an extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy that completely disintegrates the cord and separates it from the dermis. Subsequently, the resultant loosened structure is grafted with autologous lipoaspirate. After 1 week of postoperative extension splinting, patients are allowed normal hand use and are advised to use night splints for 3 to 6 months. The authors treated and report on their experience with 91 patients (99 hands) operated on in Miami and Rotterdam; from 50 patients, the authors report on goniometry (average follow-up, 44 weeks).RESULTS: The contracture from the proximal interphalangeal joint improved significantly from 61 degrees to 27 degrees, and contracture from the metacarpophalangeal joint improved from 37 degrees to -5 degrees. Ninety-four percent of patients returned to normal use of the hand within 2 to 4 weeks and 95 percent were very satisfied with the result. No new scars were added, and a supple palmar fat pad was mostly restored. Complications were digital nerve injury in one patient, postoperative wound infection in one patient, and complex regional pain syndrome in four patients.CONCLUSIONS: This new minimally invasive technique shortens recovery time, adds to the deficient subcutaneous fat, and leads to scarless supple skin. By its ability to treat multiple rays, it addresses the abnormality in the entire hand. The procedure is safe and effective, especially for primary cases.

"Night-time splinting after fasciectomy or dermo-fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture: a pragmatic, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder which can result in fixed flexion contractures of digits and impaired hand function. Standard treatment involves surgical release or excision followed by post-operative hand therapy and splinting, however the evidence supporting night splinting is of low quality and equivocal.METHODS: A multi-centre, pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of night splinting on self-reported function, finger extension and satisfaction in patients undergoing fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy. 154 patients from 5 regional hospitals were randomised after surgery to receive hand therapy only (n = 77) or hand therapy with night-splinting (n = 77). Primary outcome was self-reported function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were finger range of motion and patient satisfaction. Primary analysis was by intention to treat.RESULTS: 148 (96%) patients completed follow-up at 12 months. No statistically significant differences were observed on the DASH questionnaire (0-100 scale: adjusted mean diff. 0.66, 95%CI - 2.79 to 4.11, p = 0.703), total extension deficit of operated digits (degrees: adjusted mean diff 5.11, 95%CI -2.33 to 12.55, p = 0.172) or patient satisfaction (0-10 numerical rating scale: adjusted mean diff -0.35, 95%CI -1.04 to 0.34, p = 0.315) at 1 year post surgery. Similarly, in a secondary per protocol analysis no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in any of the outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: No differences were observed in self-reported upper limb disability or active range of motion between a group of patients who were all routinely splinted after surgery and a group of patients receiving hand therapy and only splinted if and when contractures occurred. Given the added expense of therapists' time, thermoplastic materials and the potential inconvenience to patients having to wear a device, the routine addition of night-time splinting for all patients after fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy is not recommended except where extension deficits reoccur.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial ISRCTN57079614.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,21693044,2011
Improved postoperative outcome of segmental fasciectomy in Dupuytren disease by insertion of an absorbable cellulose implant.,"In this case-control prospective study, we investigated if we could improve the surgical outcome of interrupting strands in Dupuytren disease by creating a blocking effect with an absorbable cellulose implant, a known absorbable adhesion barrier. We studied 33 operations in 29 patients who had the potential for recurrent disease. The cellulose was implanted in the first 15 patients. An intraindividual control was added in 4 patients, who were given the implant in 1 of 2 operated hands. Goniometric evolution was monitored on digital photography, and satisfaction was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a preliminary one year follow-up. With the implant the postoperative range of movement improved significantly (by 33%) and remained unchanged after three months to a one year follow-up. The VAS for satisfaction also improved. We conclude that cellulose implants may improve the outcome of segmental fasciectomy in Dupuytren disease by achieving a better extension of fingers and a higher patients' satisfaction.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,21682613,2011
The association between Peyronie's and Dupuytren's disease.,"Peyronie's disease (PD) is known to be associated with Dupuytren's disease (DD) since 1828. The aim of this study was to investigate the coexistence of DD in a consecutive series of patients with PD and their clinical characteristics. From January 1988 to December 2009 all patients, presenting at our outpatient urological clinic, with PD were also examined for DD. The sample consisted of 415 male subjects with PD, 89 (22.1%) also had DD.

Nerve blocks at the wrist for painful injections of the palm.,"PURPOSE: Injections into the palmar hand for trigger finger, palmar flexor tenosynovitis, and Dupuytren contracture can be very painful. This randomized, controlled study evaluated nerve block anesthesia at the wrist for prevention of procedural pain associated with painful injection of the palmar hand.METHODS: Forty-seven corticosteroid injections for trigger fingers in 19 individuals were randomized to (1) anesthesia consisting of median and ulnar nerve block with 1% lidocaine anesthesia followed by standard injection or (2) standard injection alone using the 1-needle 2-syringe technique consisting of transthecal dilation of the synovial sheath with 0.5 mL 1% lidocaine with a mechanical syringe, the reciprocating procedure device, followed by injection with 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide. Baseline pain, needle insertion/sheath dilation pain, corticosteroid injection pain, resolution of trigger finger, and pain at outcome (2 weeks) were determined.RESULTS: Standard injection for trigger finger was associated with significant pain in 100% of subjects. Nerve blocks at the wrist provided effective anesthesia, resulting in a 56% reduction in injection pain compared with direct injection (P &lt; 0.01). There was 100% resolution of trigger finger in both treatment groups. Pain at the 2-week outcome, reduction in pain from baseline, responders, and nonresponders were not statistically different (P &gt; 0.3 for all). Eighty-eight percent of subjects preferred nerve block anesthesia to direct injection (P &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Nerve block anesthesia at the wrist before palmar injection is preferred by patients and is highly effective in preventing pain associated with injection of the palmar hand for trigger finger and other painful hand procedures.",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic &amp; musculoskeletal diseases,21617556,2011
Reversal of TGF-β1 stimulation of α-smooth muscle actin and extracellular matrix components by cyclic AMP in Dupuytren's-derived fibroblasts.,"BACKGROUND: Myofibroblasts, a derived subset of fibroblasts especially important in scar formation and wound contraction, have been found at elevated levels in affected Dupuytren's tissues. Transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is characterized by expression of alpha- smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and increased production of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, both events of relevance to connective tissue remodeling. We propose that increasing the activation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A signaling pathway will inhibit transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1)-induced ECM synthesis and myofibroblast formation and may provide a means to blunt fibrosis.METHODS: Fibroblasts derived from areas of Dupuytren's contracture cord (DC), from adjacent and phenotypically normal palmar fascia (PF), and from palmar fascia from patients undergoing carpal tunnel release (CTR; CT) were treated with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) and/or forskolin (10 μM) (a known stimulator of cAMP). Total RNA and protein extracted was subjected to real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.RESULTS: The basal mRNA expression levels of fibronectin- extra domain A (FN1-EDA), type I (COL1A2) and type III collagen (COL3A1), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were all significantly increased in DC- and in PF-derived cells compared to CT-derived fibroblasts. The TGF-β1 stimulation of α-SMA, CTGF, COL1A2 and COL3A1 was greatly inhibited by concomitant treatment with forskolin, especially in DC-derived cells. In contrast, TGF-β1 stimulation of FN1-EDA showed similar levels of reduction with the addition of forskolin in all three cell types.CONCLUSION: In sum, increasing cAMP levels show potential to inhibit the formation of myofibroblasts and accumulation of ECM components. Molecular agents that increase cAMP may therefore prove useful in mitigating DC progression or recurrence.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,21612641,2011
Identification of mesenchymal stem cells in perinodular fat and skin in Dupuytren's disease: a potential source of myofibroblasts with implications for pathogenesis and therapy.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by aberrant proliferation of myofibroblasts, the source of which remains unknown. Recent studies indicate that circulating and tissue-resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into myofibroblasts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to profile MSCs from phenotypically distinct DD sites including cord, nodule, skin overlying nodule (SON), and perinodular fat (PNF) compared with unaffected internal controls, that is, distant palmar fat (DPF) and transverse palmar fascia (Skoog's fibers) as well as external control carpal tunnel (CT) tissue including skin, fat, and fascia. Freshly isolated primary fibroblasts as well as cells grown up to passage 5 (P5) from DD (n=27) and CT (n=14) samples were analyzed for the presence of established MSC markers CD73, CD90, and CD105 and absence of hematopoietic marker CD34 using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, in-cell quantitative western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. Freshly isolated cells from SON, PNF, and cord biopsies had a higher number of CD34(-)73(+)90(+)105(+) cells compared with Skoog's fibers and CT controls. P3 cells obtained from all DD biopsies compared with CT samples differentiated into osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. P3 cord and nodule cells expressed intense α-smooth muscle actin staining compared with skin and fat cells. Stem cell markers including stem cell factor, MSC-homing marker CXCR4, and Wnt/β-catenin downregulator Dkk-1 were all upregulated in SON and PNF compared with CT skin and CT fat, respectively, as shown by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. However, osteogenic marker OSF-1 had a significantly higher expression in the PNF (P=0.002) and cord (P=0.01) compared with the nodule. In conclusion, we have shown the presence of MSCs in specific DD tissue phenotypes compared with internal and external control tissue. These findings provide preliminary support for a potential alternative source of disease myofibroblasts originating from sites such as SON and PNF as opposed to palmar fascia alone.",Stem cells and development,21612554,2011
Percutaneous needle fasciotomy for primary Dupuytren's contracture.,"This study evaluated the effect of percutaneous needle fasciotomy on primary Dupuytren's contracture in 149 patients (213 rays) admitted to our clinic in 2007. Ninety-two patients (130 rays) were followed up for 2 years to compare the change in total passive extension deficit and the passive extension deficit across the individual joint and to note side effects. No tendon rupture or damage to sensory nerves was observed and the rehabilitation period was short (mean, 0.6 days). We found a significant change (p &lt; 0.001) in total passive extension deficit after 2 years, but the effect of the treatment was greater in Tubiana I and II stages and our best results were in correction of MCP joint contractures. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is an alternative treatment for elderly patients with severe comorbidity or for those patients who do not want open surgery.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",21593073,2011
[Dupuytren's disease: state of knowledge and research in physiopathology].,"From Baron Dupuytren's historical description up to the advent of molecular biology, many hypotheses about the etiology of Dupuytren's disease have been proposed. This bibliography of the last ten years' publications describes tissue anomalies from the macroscopic down to the ultrastructural level of pathology. The myofibroblast, which is the principal cell of the disease, is the seat of genetics anomalies involving proto-oncogenes (c-myc and MafB). Similarly, glycoproteins implicated in cellular adhesion like fibronectins and catenins are modified and overexpressed in the disease. Extracellular proteins of the metalloproteinase family exhibit many dysfunctions responsible for collagenic proliferation. Finally, growth factors like Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor maintain and worsen the disease and could be therapeutic targets in the future.",Chirurgie de la main,21592840,2011
Should we consider Dupuytren's contracture as work-related? A review and meta-analysis of an old debate.,"BACKGROUND: In view of the conflicting opinions published, a meta-analysis was undertaken on epidemiological studies in order to assess any association between Dupuytren's contracture and work exposure.METHODS: Using the key words: &quot;occupational disease&quot;, &quot;work&quot; and &quot;Dupuytren contracture&quot; without limitation on language or year of publication, epidemiological studies were selected from four databases (Pub-Med, Embase, Web of science, BDSP) after two rounds (valid control group, valid work exposure). A quality assessment list was constructed and used to isolate papers with high quality methodological criteria (scores of 13 or above, HQMC). Relevant associations between manual work, vibration exposure (at work) and Dupuytren's contracture were extracted from the articles and a metarisk calculated using the generic variance approach (meta-odds ratios, meta-OR).RESULTS: From 1951 to 2007, 14 epidemiological studies (including 2 cohort studies, 3 case-control studies, and 9 cross-sectional studies/population surveys) were included. Two different results could be extracted from five studies (based on different types of exposure), leading to 19 results, 12 for manual work (9 studies), and 7 for vibration exposure (5 studies). Six studies met the HQMC, yielding 9 results, 5 for manual work and 4 for vibration exposure. Five studies found a dose-response relationship. The meta-OR for manual work was 2.02[1.57;2.60] (HQMC studies only: 2.01[1.51;2.66]), and the meta-OR for vibration exposure was 2.88 [1.36;6.07] (HQMC studies only: 2.14[1.59;2.88]).CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis of an association between high levels of work exposure (manual work and vibration exposure) and Dupuytren's contracture in certain cases.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,21575231,2011
Needle aponeurotomy in Dupuytren's disease.,"Needle aponeurotomy (NA) is recommended as a nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren's disease. The aim of the procedure is to cut the Dupuytren's cord by use of the bevel of a needle and to restore full extension of the metacarpophalageal or proximal interphalangeal joints. According to Lermusiaux's standard, NA is performed in an outpatient setting, with the patient under local anesthesia. It entails the use of a 25-gauge, 16 mm-long needle and an anesthetic mixture of lidocaine and acetate of prednisolone. Various modifications have been proposed since the description of Lermusiaux's standard. Lermusiaux's and modified standards demonstrated structural efficacy in Dupuytren's disease. Clinical studies indicate that the mean rate of good structural results of NA is 80% at short-term assessment and 69% at 5-year assessment. Most of the studies are case series and only one is a randomized trial. Better results are demonstrated in early stages of the disease. NA also reduces disability and patients are highly satisfied. The short-term results with Lermusiaux's standard do not appear to be impaired in digital involvement. This is not the case for modified standards providing better results with palmar involvement. Lermusiaux's standard appears to provide less recurrences and less adverse events. In the largest study, skin fissure was observed in 8% of hands, transient dysesthesia in 3%, local infection in 0.7%, and flexor tendon rupture in 0.2%. Values were lower if related to NA sessions or NAs during each session. We therefore recommend Lermusiaux's standard for safe and effective NA in patients with Dupuytren's disease.","Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",21549632,2011
Dupuytren's contracture as result of prolonged administration of phenobarbital.,"Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative condition involving the superficial palmar fascia, leading to a progressive and irreversible flexion of the fingers. In literature, there are different opinions regarding the phenobarbital, a common antiepileptic drug, and its effective role in the genesis and development of Dupuytren's disease. In this retrospective investigation the association between phenobarbital and Dupuytren's contracture is discussed. Three patients in treatment with phenobarbital who had no others significant risk factors for Dupuytren's contracture were included in this study. The disease occurred after one to four years of drug therapy, at dosage of 100 mg/day. After surgery, Dupuytren's disease showed different evolutions in relation to dosage and type of antiepileptic drug used. Phenobarbital causes a dose and time-dipendent profibrotic effect. A clinical regression was observed when phenobarbital was substituted by carbamazepine, maintaining the same dosage (100 mg/day). This data confirms that not all the antiepileptic drugs are implicated in palmar fibrosis, and suggests that, according to the efficacy and adverse effects, the administration of benzodiazepine reduces the risk of Dupuytren's recurrence.",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,21528776,2011

Dupuytren's contracture: a retrospective database analysis to assess clinical management and costs in England.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a fibro-proliferative disorder affecting ~3-5% of the UK population. Current surgical treatments for Dupuytren's contracture (DC) include fasciectomy and fasciotomy. We assessed the clinical management of DC in England over a 5-year period; associated NHS costs were assessed for a 1-year period.METHODS: Hospital Episode Statistics were extracted from April 2003 to March 2008 for patients with Palmar Fascial Fibromatosis (ICD10=M720) and DC-related procedures. Variables included demographics, OPCS, patient status and physician specialty. To estimate 2010-2011 costs, HRG4 codes and the National Schedule of Tariff 2010-11-NHS Trusts were applied to the 2007-2008 period.RESULTS: Over 5 years, 75,157 DC admissions were recorded; 64,506 were analyzed. Mean admissions per year were 12,901 and stable. Day cases increased from 42% (2003-2004) to 62% (2007-2008). The percent of patients having two or more admissions per year increased from 5.5% in 2003-2004 to 26.1% in 2007-2008. Between 2003 and 2007, 91% of procedures were Fasciectomy. Revision of Fasciectomy and Fasciotomy each accounted for ~4%; Amputation for 1%. In 2007, classification was extended to identify Digital Fasciectomy, its Revision and Dermofasciectomy. In 2007-2008, admissions were: 70% Palmar Fasciectomy, 16% Digital Fasciectomy, 1.3% Other Fasciectomy, 4.4% Revision of Palmar Fasciectomy, 1.3% Revision of Digital Fasciectomy, 3.8% Division of Palmar Fascia, 2.6% Dermofasciectomy and 1.1% Amputation. 79% of cases were overseen by trauma and orthopaedic surgeons, 19% by plastic surgeons. Mean (±SD) inpatient hospital length of stay was 1.5 (±1.4) days in 2003-2004 and 1.0 (±1.3) days in 2007-2008. Total estimated costs for 1 year (2010-2011) were £41,576,141. Per-patient costs were £2,885 (day case) and £3,534 (inpatient). Costs ranged from £2,736 (day-case Fasciectomy) to £9,210 (day-case Revision Digital).CONCLUSIONS: Between 2003 and 2008, fasciectomy was the most common surgical procedure for DC in England. While procedure rates and physician specialties varied little, there was a reversal in surgical venue: inpatient operations decreased as day-case procedures increased. The change is likely due to economic trends and changes to the healthcare system. Estimated costs for 2010-2011 varied by procedure type and patient status. These findings can be used to understand clinical management of DC and guide healthcare policy.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,21486483,2011
Risk factors in Dupuytren's diathesis: is recurrence after surgery predictable?,"In order to investigate the prognostic value of possible risk factors for Dupuytren's diathesis, clinical parameters on disease presentation in an operated group of patients were compared with self-reported recurrence after a minimum 2 years follow-up. In order of significance, the following factors were found to be significantly correlated with disease recurrence : age of onset under 50 years (p = 0.01), bilateral disease (p = 0.01), Ledderhose disease (p = 0.01), first ray involvement (p = 0.02), multiple ray involvement (more than 2 digits, p = 0.02), ectopic fibromatosis (p = 0.02), family occurrence (p = 0.04) and male gender (p = 0.05). No correlation of self-reported disease recurrence was seen with diabetes, frozen shoulder syndrome or epilepsy. An insight in the significance of the influence of specific risk factors on recurrence rates, helps in creating a clearer representation of Dupuytren's diathesis. This will help the surgeon to more accurately inform the patient and possibly to reconsider and adjust the choice in treatment options.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,21473442,2011
Pressure generated by syringes: implications for hydrodissection and injection of dense connective tissue lesions.,"OBJECTIVE: Hydrodissection and high-pressure injection are important for the treatment of dense connective tissue lesions including rheumatoid nodules, Dupuytren's contracture, and trigger finger. The present study determined the optimal syringes for high-pressure injection of dense connective tissue lesions.METHODS: Different sizes (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 60 mL) of a mechanical syringe (reciprocating procedure device) with a luer-lock fitting were studied. Twenty operators generated maximum pressure with each mechanical syringe size, and pressure was measured in pounds per square inch (psi). Subsequently, 223 dense connective tissue lesions were injected with different sizes of syringes (1, 3, or 10 mL). Outcomes included (i) successful intralesional injection and (ii) clinical response at 2 weeks.RESULTS: Smaller syringes generated significantly more injection pressure than did larger syringes: 1 mL (363 ± 197 psi), 3 mL (177 ± 96 psi), 5 mL (73 ± 40 psi), 10 mL (53 ± 29 psi), 20 mL (32 ± 18 psi), and 60 mL (19 ± 12 psi). Similarly, smaller syringes were superior to larger syringes for intralesional injection success: 10 mL: 34% (15/44) vs. 1 mL: 100% (70/70) (p &lt; 0.001) and 3 mL: 91% (99/109) (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: Smaller syringes (≤ 3 mL) are superior to larger syringes (≥ 5 mL) for successful hydrodissection and high-pressure intralesional injection of dense connective tissue lesions.",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,21469942,2011
A new surgical approach to Dupuytren's disease.,"We present a new surgical approach for Dupuytren's disease which overcomes some of the problems seen with traditional approaches. The approach is simple but allows full exposure and accommodates all options for closure. It comprises transverse incisions at the skin creases of the digit joined by oblique incisions at 45°. The transverse incisions can be extended to the mid-axial line for improved exposure and skin release and to lateralize the apices of the scar. After excision of the disease and correction of the contracture the wound can be assessed and closed primarily, with advancement flaps or skin grafts, or left partially open. This study includes surgery on 105 rays in 75 patients with excellent results in 80 rays, good results in 20 rays, fair results in four rays and a poor result in one ray. There was only one significant complication.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",21467085,2011
Clinical outcomes of primary skin closure with Y-V and Z-plasties for Dupuytren's contracture: use of one-stage skin closure.,"Y-V or Z-plasties are a useful one-stage technique for skin closure after aponeurotomy. However, we know no details about postoperative improvement, particularly at each joint. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of primary skin closure with Y-V and Z-plasties for Dupuytren's contracture. We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative results of 23 patients (25 hands, 29 fingers). The preoperative severity of the contracture evaluated by the Meyerding classification was grade I in 11 fingers, II in two fingers, and III in 16 fingers. In total, 26 metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints and 27 proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints were treated. In each finger we assessed clinical outcomes according to the percentage improvement in extension and a modified version of Tubiana's classification. Primary wound closure was possible in all cases. The mean contracture values were improved from 46.5° preoperatively to 4.2° postoperatively for the MP joint and from 43.9° to 22.4° for the PIP joint. The mean percentage improvement in extension for the MP joint was 92% and for the PIP joint 56%. The rate for the PIP joint of the little finger was 40% and for the other fingers 78%. In total, 83% of the fingers had satisfactory results. For Dupuytren's contracture, primary skin closure with Y-V and Z-plasties gives satisfactory results, more so with involvement of the MP than the PIP joint and less so with involvement of the little finger.",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,21446810,2011
The efficacy and safety of fasciectomy and fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture in European patients: a structured review of published studies.,"A structured review of published papers was done to assess the efficacy and safety of fasciectomy and fasciotomy in European patients with Dupuytren's contracture. The outcomes varied across 48 studies. For fasciectomy, outcomes and results were as follows: the proportions of patients with a 100% correction in contracture angle ranged from 61 to 97%, the mean improvement in contracture angle ranged from 58 to 79%, and cases judged excellent/good ranged from 63 to 90%. Fasciotomy had similar outcomes, with a mean improvement in contracture angle ranging from 46 to 88%. Immediate failures upon recovery were reported for both procedures. The average recurrence rates were 39% after a fasciectomy and 62% after a fasciotomy at a median time of about 4 years. Overall, about 20% of fasciectomy and fasciotomy patients experienced an adverse event. In summary, postoperative outcomes were successful, but surgical complications were common and recurrence of a contracture was likely within a few years.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",21382860,2011
Management of Dupuytren contracture with ultrasound-guided lidocaine injection and needle aponeurotomy coupled with osteopathic manipulative treatment.,"Dupuytren contracture is a debilitating disease that characteristically presents as a firm nodularity on the palmar surface of the hand with coalescing cords of soft tissue on the webs and digits. With few nonsurgical modalities providing clinical benefits, open surgical procedures are the standard of care for patients with this condition. However, recent studies have associated surgical intervention with many complications, necessitating further exploration of nonsurgical treatment options. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman who presented with decreased extension of the fourth and fifth digits on the upper extremities bilaterally; previous conservative treatment regimens had been unsuccessful. After a diagnostic ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed as having Dupuytren contracture and underwent 5 treatments consisting of ultrasound-guided dry-needle aponeurotomy, lidocaine injections, and osteopathic manipulative treatment. During the fifth treatment session, the patient experienced dramatic relief of her symptoms after a palpable release during the manual manipulation portion of her therapeutic regimen. At 2-week follow-up, the patient was symptom-free. Based on this desirable outcome, the authors suggest future research be directed at minimally invasive therapeutic options in the management of Dupuytren contracture.",The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,21357497,2011
Multi-needle aponeurotomy for advanced Dupuytren's disease: preliminary results of safety and efficacy (MNA 1 study).,"AIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of multi-needle aponeurotomy (MNA) for advanced Duputren's disease.METHODS: This prospective study included patients with age more than 17 years, Dupuytren's contracture with palmo-digital or poly-digital involvement, presumed NA number needed to treat&gt;4, and availability for at least 1-month follow-up after MNA. Outcome measures were Tubiana score and passive extension deficit, after MNA and at 1 and 6 months; self-assessed disability and satisfaction at 1 and 6 months; and adverse events (AEs).RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. MNA was performed on 37 hands and 99 rays. Among 25 assessed MNA sessions for treatment-related discomfort, patients considered 22 (88%) not at all to moderately painful. Six minor AEs, representing 2 for every 100 NAs, were reported. Tubiana scores at baseline (5.3±2.3, n=35) were improved after treatment (1.7±1.8, n=32, P&lt;0.0001), at 1 month (2.2±1.4, n=26, P&lt;0.0001) and at 6 months (2.8±2.7, n=19, P&lt;0.01). Passive extension deficit was greatly reduced after treatment and persisted at follow-up. Disability scores at baseline (27.6±26.9, n=37) were reduced at 1 month (13.2±19.5, n=26, P=0.02) and at 6 months (5.2±11.6, n=20, P&lt;0.001). Patients were highly satisfied at 1 month (100%, n=25) and 6 months (95%, n=19).CONCLUSION: MNA appears safe and effective for advanced Dupuytren's disease. It could become a treatment of reference and contribute to reducing the need for surgery in this indication.","Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",21353618,2011
"[Malingue's procedure for digital retraction in Dupuytren's contracture--principle, modelling and clinical evaluation].","INTRODUCTION: Malingue's procedure is a modified Z-plasty for the treatment of digital retraction in Dupuytren's contracture. Geometrical modelling was used to determine the theoretical efficacy of the technique, and the clinical value of the method was assessed with a follow-up of 23 patients over at least two years.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Unlike Z-plasty, in which the skin flaps transposed are triangular, the Malingue plasty uses trapezoidal flaps. The direct longitudinal approach is used for the cords and the incision lines cut obliquely across the flexion folds. Euclidean geometry allows calculation of the average theoretical gain with a 45 plasty for a finger of width a, the initial surface being given by S1=a²√2, and the surface after plasty by S2=a²(3/4×[√2+1]). A continuous, homogeneous, retrospective series of 27 patients operated by the same surgeon for Dupuytren's contracture with digital flexion contracture was reviewed by a neutral observer. The technique, which combined open-palm fasciectomy with the Malingue plasty, reduced the loss of skin by extending the finger after excising the cords. The plasty was adapted to cover various skin conditions and degrees of finger flexion contracture.RESULTS: The Malingue procedure was performed as an outpatient procedure in 23 cases. The average theoretical gain of the skin surface was 46%. The results were evaluated immediately after surgery and over a mean follow-up of 31 months. There were ten cases for a first operation, ten with a first recurrence, and seven with a second recurrence. The operated fingers healed within three weeks with no skin distress or dehiscence. The only surgical complication involved a sectioned collateral radial nerve of the ring finger in a recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture; a venous sleeve was used to re-establish the continuity of the nerve. Midterm complications included CRPS in one patient, recurrence of contracture in three patients, and benign lateral hypoesthesia of the first phalanx in two patients. The mean Tubiana score, which fell from 4.0 to 0.18 immediately after surgery, was 0.67 at the last follow-up, with an overall patient satisfaction index of 95%.CONCLUSION: The Malingue plasty follows a strict but easily applicable protocol. Avoiding the use of skin grafts or flaps, the technique offers satisfactory treatment in most cases of Dupuytren's contracture.",Chirurgie de la main,21334954,2011
[Prophylaxis of CRPS I and recurrent CRPS I].,"In the foreground of the avoidance of a CRPS as well as a recurrent CRPS, also pathophysiological considerations and use-possibilities of different drugs stand beside the observance of generally valid principles for treatment. Its consistent transposition cannot certainly prevent the CRPS in each case admittedly, the installment of the appearance or recurrence of a CRPS clearly lowers however.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",21321814,2011
A questionnaire-based survey of participants' decisions regarding recruitment and retention in a randomised controlled trial - lessons learnt from the SCoRD trial.,"Successful recruitment and retention on trials is critical to ensuring that adequate power is conferred, results are generalisable and trials are completed within the allocated time and resources. Nested within an existing pragmatic randomised controlled trial a process evaluation was conducted to explore the reasons for a much higher than anticipated recruitment (120% of required sample size) and retention rate (96% completed follow-up). A questionnaire was designed to ascertain patient's views on reasons affecting consent and retention. 148 patients still enrolled in the trial at their final follow-up were either given or mailed a questionnaire of which 102 were returned (69%). 96% rated the written information as very or somewhat important in their decision to consent. Verbal information given to them by the operating surgeon was considered very or somewhat important by 86% and the relative inconvenience was rated as important by 79% of patients. Reasons for consenting for a large proportion of patents were the wish to help in research which may benefit others in the future and the perception that this was an important and relevant study. There was also some evidence that patients weighed up the demands with the potential benefits to them. High levels of satisfaction were expressed with trial personnel and trial procedures. The inclusion of a trial process evaluation such as the one presented here is an efficient method for gathering information of participants' decisions regarding recruitment and retention in a trial and can help to inform the successful planning of future trials.",Contemporary clinical trials,21300178,2011
Focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy in Dupuytren's disease--a hypothesis.,"Dupuytren's disease is a progressive disease due to unknown causal agents or genetics. An epidemiological analysis of 566 cases in North Germany estimated that around 1.9 million Germans are suffering from Dupuytren's disease. Beside Dupuytren's disease, there are a number of further less common forms of progressive fibromatosis, such as knuckle pads, plantar fibromatosis or Peyronie's disease. Surgery in plantar fasciectomy yields to a 60% recurrence rate depending on the extent of the plantar fasciectomy. Peyronie's disease of the penis affects middle-aged men between 40 and 60 years with penile pain, curvature during erection and potential erectile dysfunction. In a clinical randomized-controlled trial in Peyronie's disease 2000 focused extracorporeal shock waves reduced pain significantly and improved erectile function and quality of life. We hypothesize that focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy is able to reduce Dupuytren's contracture, a fibromatosis of the palm and improve function. Given the fact that recurrence rate in Dupuytren's disease is high und unpredictable extracorporeal shockwave therapy as a non-invasive tool might be applicable both, in primary and secondary prevention of the progression as well as for treatment. As such we have planned a randomized-controlled trial (ClinicialTrials.gov, NCT01184586) studying the effect of high-energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy on patients suffering Dupuytren's disease with patient-related outcome measures such as the DASH score and the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (MHQ) as primary outcome parameters.",Medical hypotheses,21277691,2011

[Squamous cell carcinoma in Dupuytren's disease--a case report].,"Squamous cell carcinoma in the palm is an extremely rare entity. In the following case report we describe the occurrence of a squamous cell carcinoma in the presence of Dupuytren's disease. A 49-year-old man was operated on the right hand for ulcerating Dupuytren's disease. A squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed by performing obtaining a fast section intraoperatively. The patient had an invasive, highly differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion was resected together with the Dupuytren lesion and the defect covered with a full-thickness graft. Postoperatively the patient was irradiated. He is free of recurrence for three years now. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of a squamous cell carcinoma in the presence of Dupuytren's disease.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",21225571,2011
Psychologic aspects of Dupuytren's disease: a new scale of subjective well-being of patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease usually appears in middle-age patients and is more prevalent in men than women (2-10 times less often than in men). Dupuytren's disease may accompany diabetes, smoking, alcoholism, HIV, and epilepsy. There is no cure for this disease. The disease causes a remarkable worsening of the quality of life resulting mainly from two factors: reduced physical performance or disability, and disfigurement.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 38 patients suffering from Dupuytrens's disease. The study was done in 2007-2008 at the Second Department of Surgery of the Jagiellonian University. We used the Dupuytrens disease scale of subjective well being of patients (DDSP) questionnaire covering four areas of the quality of life.RESULTS: Blue-collar workers experienced more severe problems at work than white-collar workers.CONCLUSION: There were no differences between location of the disease in left- and right-handed patients.",Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis,22593988,2011
Injectable collagenase Clostridium histolyticum: a new nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren's disease.,"PURPOSE: The Collagenase Option for the Reduction of Dupuytren's (CORD) II study investigated the efficacy and safety of injectable Xiaflex (collagenase clostridium histolyticum), in patients with Dupuytren's contracture.METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 90-day double-blind and 9-month open-label phases. We randomized patients with contractures affecting metacarpophalangeal (MCP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints 2 to 1 to collagenase (0.58 mg) or placebo. Cords received a maximum of 3 injections. Cord disruption was attempted the day after injection using a standardized finger extension procedure. Primary end point was reduction in contracture to 0° to 5° of normal 30 days after the last injection.RESULTS: We enrolled 66 patients; 45 cords (20 MCP to 25 PIP joints) received collagenase and 21 cords (11 MCP to 10 PIP joints) received placebo in the double-blind phase. Statistically significantly more cords injected with collagenase than placebo met the primary end point (44.4% vs 4.8%; p &lt;. 001). The mean percentage decrease in degree of joint contracture from baseline to 30 days after last injection was 70.5% ± 29.2% in the collagenase group and 13.6% ± 26.1% in the placebo group (p &lt; .001). The mean increase in range of motion was significantly greater in the collagenase (35.4° ± 17.8°) than in the placebo (7.6° ± 14.9°; p &lt; .001) group. Efficacy after open-label treatment was similar to that after the double-blind phase: 50.7% of all joints achieved 0° to 5° of normal. More patients were satisfied with collagenase (p &lt; .001). No joint had recurrence of contracture. One patient had a flexion pulley rupture and one patient underwent routine fasciectomy to address cord proliferation and sensory abnormality. No tendon ruptures or systemic allergic reactions were reported. Most adverse events were related to the injection or finger extension procedure.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved, nonsurgical treatment option for adult Dupuytren's contracture patients with a palpable cord that is highly effective and well tolerated.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.",The Journal of hand surgery,21134613,2010

The QuickDASH score: a patient-reported outcome measure for Dupuytren's surgery.,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort.INTRODUCTION: There is currently no validated patient reported outcome measure (PROM) for Dupuytren's disease. We have performed a retrospective analysis of QuickDASH scores taken before and after surgery for Dupuytren's disease to assess the validity and responsiveness of the QuickDASH and evaluate its suitability to being a PROM for this condition.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To determine the eligibility of the QuickDASH score as a Patient Reported Outcome Measure for Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: Patients were identified from the hand therapy database that had surgery performed between January 2006 and April 2008 who had documented pre- and post-operative QuickDASH scores.RESULTS: 69 patients were identified with complete datasets with a mean change in QuickDASH score of -7.14 (p &lt; 0.001) and an improvement of extension deficit by 68.1 degrees (p &lt; 0.001) at a mean 110 day follow-up. The change in QuickDASH score did not correlate with the change in extension deficit. The effect size was 0.545 and the standardised response mean was 0.580.CONCLUSION: The QuickDASH is an acceptable PROM for Dupuytren's surgery with limitations. Further research is needed examining PROMs with this common condition.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: n/a.,Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,21106346,2010
Characterization of stem cells in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibroproliferative disease of unknown origin. The source of abnormal cells leading to DD formation remains underexplored. In addition to fascia, palmar skin and fat-derived cells may be a potential source of cells causing DD. This study aimed to profile haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells in different DD tissue components compared with tissue removed at carpal tunnel surgery (control).METHODS: Biopsies were taken from the diseased cord, nodule, perinodular fat and skin overlying the nodule of ten patients with DD and compared with control tissue from seven patients having surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) were used to identify expression of selected stem cell markers.RESULTS: FACS and QRT-PCR analysis identified the highest RNA expression and number of cells positive for adipocyte stem cell markers (CD13 and CD29) in the DD nodule in comparison with carpal tunnel control tissue (P = 0·053). CD34 RNA was overexpressed, and a higher percentage of these cells was present in DD skin compared with carpal tunnel skin (P = 0·001).CONCLUSION: Each structural component of DD (cord, nodule, perinodular fat and skin) had distinct stem cell populations. These findings support the hypothesis that DD may result from mesenchymal progenitor cell expansion.",The British journal of surgery,21104823,2010
Scientific understanding and clinical management of Dupuytren disease.,"Dupuytren disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiology that often results in shortening and thickening of the palmar fascia, leading to permanent and irreversible flexion contracture of the digits. This Review provides a detailed update of the scientific understanding of DD and its clinical management, with perspectives on emerging research and therapy. Established risk factors include genetic predisposition and ethnicity, as well as sex and age. Several environmental risk factors (some considered controversial) include smoking, alcohol intake, trauma, diabetes, epilepsy and use of anticonvulsant drugs, and exposure to vibration. DD has been variously attributed to the presence of oxygen free radicals, trauma to the palmar fascia, or aberrant immune responses with altered antigen presentation, or to interactions between these proposed mechanisms. The presence of immune cells and related phenomena in DD-affected tissue suggests that DD is possibly immune-related. Mechanically, digital contracture is caused by myofibroblasts in the DD palmar fascia; however, the exact origin of this cell type remains unknown. The mainstay of treatment is surgical release or excision of the affected palmodigital tissue, but symptoms often recur. Nonsurgical correction of DD contractures can be achieved by Clostridium histolyticum collagenase injection, although the long-term safety and recurrence rate of this procedure requires further assessment.",Nature reviews.

[Plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose's disease)].,"The authors describe the concomitant presence of plantar fibromatosis and Dupuytren's disease in a 33-year-old man. A lesion located under the sesamoid bones of the first metatarsophalangeal joint on the right showed an aggressive tendency (rapid growth, pain, impossibility to put weight on the medial side of the foot). Another lesion located proximal to the first one was smaller and painless. Neither plain radiography nor computed tomography showed any structural changes of the skeleton. Contrast-enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging revealed two lesions on the sole of the foot. Since a concurrence of plantar fibromatosis and malignant tumour could not be ruled out, an excision of both lesions and the adjacent plantar aponeurosis was made for biopsy examination. The operative procedure was carried out from two incisions.The intra-operative findings included proliferative growth and bleeding in the lesion located under the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and delimited growth without noticeable bleeding in the other lesion. Based on histological examination, the diagnosis of plantar fibromatosis was made for both lesions.The differential diagnosis and therapy of plantar fibromatosis is discussed.",Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,21059334,2010
Kaposi's sarcoma after repeated surgical procedures in an immunocompetent patient: the lymphatic hypothesis.,"A 63-year-old Swiss patient developed acquired nodules on his right palm after 3 localized surgeries, called 'needle fasciotomy', for Dupuytren's disease. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was diagnosed in a biopsy of a nodule. A positive immunolabeling and serology for human herpesvirus 8 has been found, but human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C identification remained negative. The nodules were limited to the surgically traumatized area. This first report of a nonimmunocompromised patient developing a KS after repeated surgeries in a unique peculiar localized area with a dense lymphatic network sustains the hypothesis that tissue alterations involving the lymphatic system could play a central role in the occurrence of KS.","Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)",21051867,2010
Genome-wide association scan of Dupuytren's disease.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) has a strong genetic component that is suggested by population studies and family clustering. Genetic studies have yet to identify the gene(s) involved in DD. The purpose of this study was to identify regions of the entire genome (chromosomes 1-23) associated with the disease by performing a genome-wide association scan on DD patients and controls.METHODS: We isolated genomic DNA from saliva collected from 40 unrelated DD patients and 40 unaffected controls. We conducted the genotyping using CytoSNP-Infinium HD Ultra genotyping assay on the Illumina platform. Using both log regression and mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium analysis methods, we analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data.RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed a significant association in regions for chromosomes 1, 3 through 6, 11, 16, 17, and 23. Mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium analysis showed ancestry-associated regions in chromosomes 2, 6, 8, 11, 16, and 20, which may harbor DD susceptibility genes. Both analysis methods revealed loci association in chromosomes 6, 11, and 16.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that chromosomes 6, 11, and 16 may contain the genes for DD and that multiple genes may be involved in DD. Future genetic studies on DD should focus on these areas of the genome.",The Journal of hand surgery,20971583,2010

Severity of contracture and self-reported disability in patients with Dupuytren's contracture referred for surgery.,"The purpose of the study was to explore the relationship between preoperative flexion contracture (FC) and self-reported disability in patients undergoing surgical release by fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy. The study design used was a prospective observational study: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia and may lead to functional deficits requiring surgical intervention. Outcomes are usually reported using digital range of motion although recent studies have also included patient-rated outcome measures with the extensively validated Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire commonly used. One hundred fifty-four patients consecutively enrolled in a prospective randomized trial were assessed before surgery for active range of movement using goniometry and self-reported functioning using DASH questionnaire. The small finger was affected in 69% of patients with a mean FC of 77.8 degrees (standard deviation=43.5°). The mean DASH score was 16 points (range, 0-62). The correlation between severity of FC in all four fingers and DASH was weak (r=0.264, p=0.001). At individual digital level, the correlation between FC and DASH was weak in the index (r=0.26), middle (r=0.28), and ring (r=0.21) fingers but almost absent in the small finger (r=0.07).

Dupuytren's fibroblast contractility by sphingosine-1-phosphate is mediated through non-muscle myosin II.,"PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that Dupuytren's disease is caused by fibroblast and myofibroblast contractility within Dupuytren's nodules; however, the stimulus for cell contractility is unknown. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a serum-derived lysophospholipid mediator that enhances cell contractility by activating the S1P receptor, S1P(2). It is hypothesized that S1P stimulates Dupuytren's fibroblast contractility through S1P(2) activation of non-muscle myosin II (NMMII). This investigation examined the role of S1P and NMMII activation in Dupuytren's disease progression and suggests potential targets for treatment.METHODS: We enmeshed Dupuytren's fibroblasts into fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCLs) and assayed S1P-stimulated FPCL contraction in the presence of the S1P(2) receptor inhibitor JTE-013, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7, and the NMMII inhibitor blebbistatin. Tissues from Dupuytren's fascia (n = 10) and normal palmar fascia (n = 10) were immunostained for NMMIIA and NMMIIB.RESULTS: Sphingosine-1-phosphate stimulated FPCL contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of S1P(2) and NMMII prevented S1P-stimulated FPCL contraction. Rho kinase and myosin light chain kinase inhibited both S1P and control FPCL contraction. Dupuytren's nodule fibroblasts robustly expressed NMMIIA and NMMIIB, compared with quiescent-appearing cords and normal palmar fascia.CONCLUSIONS: Sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes Dupuytren's fibroblast contractility through S1P(2), which stimulates activation of NMMII. NMMII isoforms are ubiquitously expressed throughout Dupuytren's nodules, which suggests that nodule fibroblasts are primed to respond to S1P stimulation to cause contracture formation. S1P-promoted activation of NMMII may be a target for disease treatment.",The Journal of hand surgery,20888494,2010
[Dupuytren's contracture: percutaneous needle aponeurotomy is an alternative to surgery].,"Dupuytren's contracture is a retractile fibrosis of the superficial palmar aponeurosis of the hand, resulting in a progressive and fixed flexion of the fingers that may result in severe limitation of hand function. It affects several millions of people in Europe and North America. Risk factors are genetic and sometimes related to mellitus diabetes. There is no spontaneous remission. Until recently, surgery was the only treatment, but now needle aponeurotomy emerges as a therapeutic alternative. It should be performed as first line treatment by a trained practitioner. Short and long-term results of needle aponeurotomy appear identical to those of surgery, with milder complications. It is indicated in palmar, palmo-digital, as well as in strictly digital forms of the disorder. The &quot;table-test&quot; is used to assess the loss of extension of the digit and to select the indication to needle aponeurotomy.

[Ultrasound imaging of Dupuytren's contracture].,"Dupuytren's contracture is characterized by two underlying lesions, nodules and cords. These involve the palmar fascia at the distal palmar crease, especially at the level of the third and fourth rays with progressive disabling finger contracture. The superficial palmar aponeurosis appears as a thin echogenic lamellar structure overlying the flexor tendons. The demonstration of hypoechoic bands adhering to the marging of the flexor tendons and deep surface of the dermis appears to be pathognomonic of the disease. Compared to tendons, early nodules are hypoechoic and typically hypervascular whereas older nodules are iso- to hyperechoic, without hypervascular Doppler signal. Ultrasound can sometimes demonstrate arterial encasement by fibrous or scarring tissue. Ultrasound therefore is very useful for the differential diagnosis of pathologies involving the palmar surface of the hand, for the early detection of Dupuytren's contracture, and for the detection of complication, especially vascular. These data may have an impact on management.",Journal de radiologie,20808269,2010
Dorsal pads versus nodules in normal population and Dupuytren's disease patients.,"PURPOSE: There is ambiguity about using the term &quot;knuckle pads&quot; in Dupuytren's disease (DD). Clear definitions of dorsal knuckle pads and nodules are lacking and the prevalence of these 2 entities has not been determined. We sought to define these terms and investigate the distribution and frequency of dorsal knuckle pads and dorsal nodules in the normal volunteers and in DD patients.METHODS: We assessed 50 consecutive study patients with DD and a convenience sample group of 50 control patients without DD for dorsal cutaneous pads (DCP) (ie, thickening, sclerosis, and loss of skin elasticity) and dorsal Dupuytren's nodules (DDN) (ie, solid tumor-like masses over the digital joints). Demographic information was collected for both groups, including the extent of the disease in DD patients. We examined both groups for the presence of dorsal lesions and their characteristics, and the DD patients for other local and ectopic Dupuytren's lesions and for the level of diathesis.RESULTS: None of the control patients had DDN, whereas 9 DD patients had DDN (p = .002). Nine control patients had DCP, whereas 11 DD patients had DCP (p = .803) Among the 9 control patients with DCP, pads were predominantly over the proximal interphalangeal joints and tended to occur in men with physically demanding occupations, and in the dominant hand. The index and long fingers were most frequently affected. Six patients had only DCP, 4 had only DDN, and 5 had both DDN and DCP. In the control and study groups, the DCP characteristics and patients' demographic data were comparable. Patients with DDN were white men with physically undemanding occupations and had lesions over the proximal interphalangeal joints, most frequently in the index finger, with an average size of 6 mm. Neither DCP nor DDN were encountered in the thumb.CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should clearly distinguish between DCP and DDN. Although DDN are pathognomonic of DD, DCP demonstrates similar prevalence in normal and DD populations.",The Journal of hand surgery,20800974,2010
Review: Dupuytren's disease in Asia and the migration theory of Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The presentation of a Chinese patient with unilateral Dupuytren's disease (DD) prompted a literature search and a review of the epidemiology of DD in the Asian population as it has never been cumulatively reported. The purpose of this paper is to review all the reported cases of DD in the literature and aetiological links to DD elsewhere.METHODS: The literature was searched with a wide variety of terms, and subsequent references were analysed and further references investigated for other reported cases of DD in the Asian population.RESULTS: This review found 595 cases and has shown that DD is present to a variable extent in China (96 cases), Thailand (19 cases), Vietnam (one case), India (15 cases) and Japan (474 cases). A total of 54% had bilateral disease. Risk factors (diabetes, trauma, epilepsy, alcoholism, manual labour) were reportedly present in 65% of the patients, and a positive family history was reported in 9%. The average patient age was 67 years.CONCLUSION: This review shows that there is a low but significant incidence of DD across Asia, which supports the hypothesis of a widespread genetic susceptibility to the disease. Therefore, the prevalence of DD in this community is not likely due to sporadic genetic mutation as previously presumed but rather individual genetic susceptibility and that risk factors play a major role in the expression of DD in this population.",ANZ journal of surgery,20795961,2010
A high prevalence of Dupuytren's disease in Flanders.,"Dupuytren's disease has been the subject of numerous epidemiological surveys attempting to expand our knowledge on its origin and spread. In Flanders, although numerous studies on surgical outcome have been reported, information on prevalence of Dupuytren's disease is lacking. Therefore, Flanders' population in a non-hospital environment was studied by a clinical evaluation performed by a single hand specialist. Five different market places spread geographically in the 5 Flemish provinces of Belgium were visited to examine the hands of randomly chosen individuals over 50 years old visiting the market. In all, 500 people were examined; Dupuytren's disease was found to be present in 32% of the population. Nodules without finger contractures (stage 1) were seen in 24% of the population, in comparable proportions in males (28%) and females (20%). However, finger contractures (stage 2) were seen in 8%, significantly more often in males (11%) than in females (4%). The prevalence of stage 1 is somewhat lower in individuals over 80 years old. In men, the incidence of stage 2 was found to increase with age. These findings were compared with literature data on the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease in other countries and populations. It appears that, similar to northern Europe, Dupuytren's disease is also a common disease in Flanders.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,20698450,2010
Unique microRNA profile in Dupuytren's contracture supports deregulation of β-catenin pathway.,"Dupuytren's contracture, a proliferative disease of unknown origin, is characterized by an abnormal fibroblast proliferation process. Evidence from numerous microRNA (miRNA) studies shows that miRNAs have a vital function in many biological processes, for instance, in cellular signaling networks, cell growth, tissue differentiation, and cell proliferation. Our aim was to characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, the miRNA-expression profile of Dupuytren's contracture. The miRNAs identified may have a function in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture by targeting and regulating important pathways. We compared the miRNA-expression profile of 29 Dupuytren's contracture patients with that of control samples (fibroblast cells and palmar fascia). Some of the miRNAs identified in our Dupuytren's contracture samples, including miR-29c, miR-130b, miR-101, miR-30b, and miR-140-3p, were found to regulate important genes related to the β-catenin pathway: WNT5A, ZIC1, and TGFB1. Expression profiles of these genes reanalyzed from published gene-expression data from similar patient material correlated with our miRNA results. Analysis was also performed for groups of patients with recurrent/non-recurrent and patients with hereditary/non-hereditary Dupuytren's contracture, but no significant differences appeared in miRNA-expression profiles of these groups. Identification of unique miRNA expression in Dupuytren's contracture may lead to the development of novel molecular therapy for its treatment.","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",20676061,2010
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum for Dupuytren's contracture.,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Dupuytren's disease is a non-malignant, progressive disorder of the hands that can severely limit hand function and diminish overall quality of life. With global life expectancy increasing, the prevalence of this disease appears to be increasing amongst all ethnic groups. Treatment has traditionally remained surgical with few effective, nonsurgical options. However, with the introduction of collagenase clostridium histolyticum to treat Dupuytren's contractures, physicians and surgeons may be provided with a new, office-based, non-surgical option to treat this disease.AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The literature behind the use of collagenase to treat Dupuytren's disease; including its mechanism of action, safety, efficacy and clinical evidence behind its recent FDA approval.WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The latest information available on collagenase through a comprehensive review of PubMed and the websites of licensing organizations for medicinal products.TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Phase III, clinical trials on collagenase for treatment of Dupuytren's contractures have recently been completed. Meeting primary and secondary objectives, collagenase has obtained FDA approval for clinical use. Collagenase now provides a non-operative option for Dupuytren's disease. Although short-term results show that collagenase is safe and efficacious, long-term effects of repeat injections and contracture recurrence rates have yet to be examined.",Expert opinion on biological therapy,20666587,2010
The outcome of surgical treatments for primary Dupuytren's disease--a systematic review.,"There is no consensus on the most effective operation for primary Dupuytren's contracture. This systematic review evaluates the reported rates of recurrence and complications, as well as the strength of evidence, for individual procedures. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for papers in English containing 'Dupuytren' in the citation. The initial search produced 2155 references, of which 69 papers met the study inclusion criteria. There was wide disparity in scoring systems, definition of recurrence and recording of complications. Follow-up ranged from 3 weeks to 13 years, and recurrence from 0 to 71%. There are only three Level I studies comparing surgical techniques for the treatment of primary Dupuytren's contracture, and the evidence does not support one procedure above another, other than to show a particularly high recurrence rate after needle fasciotomy. We propose a minimum data set for future studies.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",20621942,2010
Genome-wide high-resolution screening in Dupuytren's disease reveals common regions of DNA copy number alterations.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a familial disorder with a high genetic susceptibility in white people; however, its etiopathogenesis remains unknown. Previous comparative genomic hybridization studies using lower-resolution, 44-k oligonucleotide-based arrays revealed no copy number variation (CNV) changes in DD. In this study, we used a higher-resolution genome-wide screening (next-generation microarrays) comprising 963,331 human sequences (3 kb spacing between probes) for whole genome DNA variation analysis. The objective was to detect cryptic chromosomal imbalances in DD.METHODS: Agilent SurePrint G3 microarrays, one million format (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), were used to detect CNV regions (CNVRs) in DNA extracted from nodules of 4 white men with DD (age, 69 +/- 4 y). Reference samples were from the DNA of 10 men who served as control patients. Copy number variations that were common to greater than 3 assessed DD individuals (p &lt; .05) were selected as candidate loci for DD etiology. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) assays were designed for selected CNVRs on DNA from 13 DD patients and 11 control patients. Independent t-tests and Fisher's exact tests were carried out for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Three novel CNVs previously unreported in the phenotypically normal population were detected in 3 DD cases, located at 10q22, 16p12.1, and 17p12. Nine polymorphic CNVRs potentially associated with DD were determined using our strategic selection criteria, locating to chromosomes 1q31, 6p21, 7p14, 8p11, 12p13, 14q11, 17q21 and 20p13. More than 3 of the DD cases tested had a CNVR located to a small region on 6p21 and 4 CNVRs within 6p21-22 of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes.CONCLUSIONS: Three novel copy number alterations were observed in 3 unrelated patients with sporadic (no known family history) DD. Nine polymorphic CNVRs were found to be common among the DD cases. These variants might contain genes involved in DD formation, indicating that important gene networks expressed within the palmar fascia might contribute to genetic susceptibility of DD.",The Journal of hand surgery,20561756,2010

Simultaneous carpal tunnel release and Dupuytren's fasciectomy.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) consider it safe to perform concurrent carpal tunnel release (CTR) and Dupuytren fasciectomy, and to report our own experience with simultaneous CTR and fasciectomy.METHODS: An e-mail survey was sent to all active members of the ASSH regarding their preferences in the concurrent surgical management of carpal tunnel syndrome and Dupuytren's disease. In addition, 70 patients who had had simultaneous CTR and Dupuytren's fasciectomy were identified in a retrospective chart review from a 7-person hand surgery group. Data on the severity of disease and risk factors for intraoperative, early, and late complications were collected for these patients. Comparison groups of 50 patients having fasciectomy alone and 50 patients having CTR alone were also compiled for internal comparison.RESULTS: The survey response rate was 50% (698/1399 respondents). Fifty percent of the responding ASSH members replied that they would not or would only sometimes perform these 2 procedures together because of concern for the development of complex regional pain syndrome and postoperative stiffness. Two of 70 patients experienced a transient pain flare, and 1 of 70 experienced stiffness, which was comparable to internal and literature controls for Dupuytren's fasciectomy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Controversy exists among ASSH members in regard to treating carpal tunnel syndrome and Dupuytren's disease simultaneously. Based on our findings, we recommend performing both of these procedures at the same surgical session, thereby dispelling the myth that simultaneous surgery has an increased complication rate.",The Journal of hand surgery,20438993,2010
Post-transcriptional regulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin determines the contractile phenotype of Dupuytren's nodular cells.,"The objective was to study Dupuytren's myofibroblast cells in constrained collagen matrices in order to more closely emulate their in vivo environment and, to correlate their contractility with alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and determine if dermal fibroblasts regulate Dupuytren's myofibroblast phenotype. Isotonic and isometric force contraction by cells isolated from Dupuytren's nodules, palmar and non-palmar skin fibroblasts was measured in collagen matrices. The effect of co-culturing nodule cells with dermal fibroblasts on isometric contraction was examined. Isometric contraction was correlated with levels of alpha-SMA mRNA by pcr and protein by Western blotting, and alpha-SMA distribution assessed by immunofluorescence. Dupuytren's nodule cells exhibited similar levels of isotonic contraction to both palmar and non-palmar dermal fibroblasts. However, nodule cells generated high levels of isometric force (mean: 3.5 dynes/h), which continued to increase over 24 h to a maximum of 173 dynes. In contrast, dermal fibroblasts initially exhibited low levels of contraction (mean: 0.5 dynes/h) and reached tensional homeostasis on average after 15 h (range: 4-20 h), with a maximum force of 52 dynes. Although all three cell types had similar alpha-SMA mRNA levels, increased levels of alpha-SMA protein were observed in nodule cells compared to dermal fibroblasts. alpha-SMA localised to stress fibres in 35% (range: 26-50%) of nodule cells compared to only 3% (range:0-6%) of dermal fibroblasts. Co-cultures of Dupuytren's cells and dermal fibroblasts showed no contractile differences. The contractile phenotype of Dupuytren's myofibroblasts is determined by increased alpha-SMA protein distributed in stress fibres, not by cellular mRNA levels. Dupuytren's cell contractility is not influenced by dermal fibroblasts.",Journal of cellular physiology,20432463,2010
Collagenase injection as nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease: 8-year follow-up.,"PURPOSE: Collagenase has been investigated in phase II and phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. The purpose of this study is to report 8-year follow-up results in a subset of patients who had collagenase injection for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.METHODS: Twenty-three patients who participated in the phase II clinical trial of injectable collagenase were contacted by letter and phone. Eight patients were enrolled, completed a Dupuytren's disease questionnaire, and had independent examination of joint motion by a single examiner.RESULTS: Eight patients completed the 8-year follow-up study: 6 had been treated for isolated metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint contracture, and 2 had been treated for isolated proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture. Average preinjection contracture was 57 degrees in the MCP group. Average contracture was 9 degrees at 1 week, 11 degrees at 1 year, and 23 degrees at 8-year follow-up. Four of 6 patients experienced recurrence, and 2 of 6 had no evidence of disease recurrence at 8-year follow-up. Average preinjection contracture was 45 degrees in the PIP group. Average contracture was 8 degrees at 1 weeks, 15 degrees at 1 year, and 60 degrees at 8-year follow-up. Both patients experienced recurrence at 8-year follow-up. No patients had had further intervention on the treated finger in either the MCP or the PIP group. Patients subjectively rated the overall clinical success at 60%, and 88% of patients stated that they would pursue further injection for the treatment of their recurrent or progressive Dupuytren's disease.CONCLUSIONS: Enzymatic fasciotomy is safe and efficacious, with initial response to injection resulting in reduction of joint contracture to within 0 degrees -5 degrees of normal in 72 out of 80 patients. Initial evaluation of long-term recurrence rates suggests disease recurrence or progression in 4 out of 6 patients with MCP contractures and 2 patients with PIP contractures; however, recurrence was generally less severe than the initial contracture in the MCP group. In addition, patient satisfaction was high.",The Journal of hand surgery,20353858,2010
Re-visiting Luck's classification: a histological analysis of Dupuytren's disease.,"Luck (1959) described a histological staging system for Dupuytren's disease, classifying the disease into three stages. Previous biochemical and immunochemical studies have detailed the decrease in type III/I collagen ratio with disease progression. Herovici (1963) described a histological stain that produced a differential red/purple and blue colour for type I and III collagen respectively. We stained 15 specimens of Dupuytren's disease and quantified the different collagen types in each using computer analysis. We found a corresponding decrease in the amount of type III collagen as a percentage of the total collagen with disease progression: stage I range 35-49% (mean 38%); stage 2 range 21-33% (mean 27%) and stage 3 range 11-19% (mean 14%). We propose a new staging system based on the relative amount of type III collagen, where stage 1: &gt;35%, stage 2: &gt;20% and &lt;35%, and stage 3: &lt;20%.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",20181770,2010
"Effectiveness of interventions of specific complaints of the arm, neck, and/or shoulder: 3 musculoskeletal disorders of the hand. An update.","OBJECTIVES: To provide an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of conservative and surgical interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren's, and De Quervain's diseases.DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched to identify relevant studies.STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to select potential relevant studies from the title and abstracts of the references retrieved by the literature search. Relevant (Cochrane) reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted the data and performed a methodologic quality assessment.DATA SYNTHESIS: A best-evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results of the included trials. One Cochrane review (trigger finger) and 13 RCTs (trigger finger [6], Dupuytren's [4], De Quervain's [3]) were included. The trials reported on physiotherapy (De Quervain's), steroid injections (trigger finger, De Quervain's), surgical treatment (trigger finger, De Quervain's), and a postsurgical treatment (Dupuytren's). For trigger finger, moderate evidence was found for the effectiveness of steroid injections in the short-term (1-4 wk) but not for long-term outcomes. Limited evidence was found for the effectiveness of staples compared with sutures in skin closure and for intermittent compression after surgery to treat Dupuytren's disease. For other interventions, no evidence was found.CONCLUSIONS: Indications for effectiveness of some interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren's, and De Quervain's diseases were found. Because only a few RCTs were identified, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. High-quality RCTs are clearly needed in this field.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,20159137,2010
The prognosis of fasciectomy for abductor digiti minimi and pretendinous cords in Dupuytren's disease of the little finger.,"Thirty-nine consecutive patients with little finger Dupuytren's contracture underwent open fasciectomy. Diseased abductor digiti minimi (ADM) pretendinous (PT) cords were identified. The mean pre-operative PIPJ contracture was 77 degrees in the PT group and 66 degrees in the ADM group. Mean residual deformity was 12 degrees in the PT group and 9 degrees in the ADM group. At six months, ten out of 27 patients had developed a recurrent deformity in the PT group (mean 24 degrees ) and seven out of 11 in the ADM group (mean 18 degrees ). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at any stage. Dupuytren's contracture of the little finger is as a result of an ADM cord in 29% of cases. In this series it led to an isolated contracture of the PIPJ in the majority of cases and rarely affected the MCPJ. Disease of the ADM cord was not associated with a difference in contracture or prognosis compared to a PT cord.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,20135734,2010
Radiotherapy in early-stage Dupuytren's contracture. Long-term results after 13 years.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In early-stage Dupuytren's contracture, radiotherapy is applied to prevent disease progression. Long-term outcome and late toxicity of the treatment were evaluated in a retrospective analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 12/1982 and 02/2006, 135 patients (208 hands) were irradiated with orthovoltage (120 kV; 20 mA; 4-mm Al filter), in two courses with five daily fractions of 3.0 Gy to a total dose of 30 Gy; separated by a 6- to 8-week interval. The extent of disease was described according to a modified classification of Tubiana et al. Long-term outcome was analyzed at last follow-up between 02/2008 and 05/2008 with a median follow-up of 13 years (range, 2-25 years). Late treatment toxicity and objective reduction of symptoms as change in stage and numbers of nodules and cords were evaluated and used as evidence to assess treatment response.RESULTS: According to the individual stages, 123 cases (59%) remained stable, 20 (10%) improved, and 65 (31%) progressed. In stage N 87% and in stage N/I 70% remained stable or even regressed. In more advanced stages, the rate of disease progression increased to 62% (stage I) or 86% (stage II). 66% of the patients showed a long-term relief of symptoms (i.e., burning sensations, itching and scratching, pressure and tension). Radiotherapy did not increase the complication rate after surgery in case of disease progression and only minor late toxicity (skin atrophy, dry desquamation) could be observed in 32% of the patients. There was no evidence for a second malignancy induced by radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: After a mean follow-up of 13 years radiotherapy is effective in prevention of disease progression and improves patients' symptoms in early-stage Dupuytren's contracture (stage N, N/I). In case of disease progression after radiotherapy, a &quot;salvage&quot; operation is still feasible.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Does postoperative hand elevation reduce swelling? A randomized study.,The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of limb elevation on hand swelling after surgery. We prospectively randomized 113 patients undergoing fasciectomy or a trapeziectomy into one of two groups. The first group had the hand elevated postoperatively and the hands of the second group were not elevated. Hand swelling was assessed using a volumetric method. Although the swelling was less in the elevated group this did not reach statistical significance. Subgroup analysis revealed no further significant differences. There were no complications in patients who did not have limb elevation. This study does not support the routine use of elevation for 24 hours after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease and trapeziectomy to reduce hand swelling.,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",20118124,2010
Radiation therapy for early stages of morbus Ledderhose.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of early stages of benign plantar fibromatosis (Morbus Ledderhose [ML]).PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2003 to 2008, 24 patients (33 sites) with a mean age of 52 years received RT for symptomatic ML. Prior to RT, 19 patients complained of pain and 15 had walking difficulties. 21 patients (28 sites) were irradiated with orthovoltage X-rays and three (five sites) received electron-beam irradiation. The RT protocol consisted of five weekly fractions of 3.0 Gy (15 Gy), repeated after 6 weeks to a total dose of 30 Gy in 20 patients (28 sites). In four patients (five sites), two single fractions of 4.0 Gy were applied, repeated at intervals of 4 weeks to total doses of 24-32 Gy. Primary study endpoints were the prevention of disease progression and the avoidance of a surgical intervention. Secondary endpoints were pain relief, improvement of gait, and patients' subjective satisfaction measured with a linear analog scale (LAS).RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 22.5 months, none of the patients experienced a progression of number and size of the lesions or the clinical symptoms. In eleven sites (33.3%) complete remission of cords or nodules occurred, in 18 (54.5%) a reduced number or size was noted, and four sites (12.1%) were unchanged. Pain relief was achieved in 13/19 patients (68.4%), and an improvement of gait abnormalities was noted in 11/15 patients (73.3%). The patients' subjective satisfaction measured by means of the LAS revealed a median improvement of 3.5 points in 22/24 patients (91.6%). Skin or soft tissues toxicities RTOG grade &gt; 2 were not noted.CONCLUSION: RT is effective for treatment of the early stages of ML and may obviate the need for a surgical intervention. Long-term follow-up studies including a larger number of patients are required to define the role of RT in the management of this disorder.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Aggressive Dupuytren's diathesis in a young woman.,"Dupuytren's disease is a palmar fascia pathology characterised by flexion contracture of the involved fingers in late stages. It has been described a higher prevalence in northern populations, especially in men in the fifth or sixth decade of life.1 Alcohol consumption, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and some of its treatments, tobacco smokers or hand workers are only a example of the different aetiologies proposed. There are a group of patients presenting with more aggressive clinical manifestation named Dupuytren's diathesis. This subtype could frequently present a positive family history, ectopic fibromatosis and bilateral hand affectation. The authors present a 24-year-old woman referred to the Plastic Surgery Department because severe fingers contracture with an associated aggressive plantar fibromatosis.

Functional genomics in identification of drug targets in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Although functional genomics methods offer new viewpoint on molecular processes involved in particular pathological state, these methods, in particular proteomics, are still under-represented in Dupuytren's contracture research. However, several recent papers based on functional genomics technologies represent a breakthrough in studying Dupuytren's contracture as they revealed new molecular players that had been impossible to detect by traditional molecular biology methods. Using computational tools to provide biological context for such broad arrays of data accelerates the process of homing in on the potential molecular markers and drug targets. Interactomes, maps of protein-protein interactions characteristic for the disease and as such putative models of its molecular pathology, are especially useful for this purpose, facilitating the transition from global screening methods to specific experiments aimed at therapy development. The combination of these approaches in Dupuytren's contracture research might therefore facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers indicative of disease progression.",Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),20036806,2009
The association between intraoperative correction of Dupuytren's disease and residual postoperative contracture.,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative contracture and the amount of intraoperative correction can be used to predict the postoperative outcome of fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease. A prospective study of 52 patients undergoing primary fasciectomy during an 18 month period was undertaken. The contracture of each joint was measured preoperatively, after fasciectomy during the operation and 6 months after surgery. Forty-two metacarpophalangeal (MCPJ) and 58 proximal interphalangeal (PIPJ) joints were treated surgically. Full intraoperative correction was achieved in 41 MCPJs. Thirty-seven had full correction at follow-up. Full intraoperative correction was obtained in 35 PIPJs and 13 had complete correction at follow-up. The extent of the preoperative deformity was a significant predictor of complete intraoperative correction. The extent of both preoperative deformity and intraoperative correction were significant predictors of loss of surgical correction after operation.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",20007420,2009

"A cross-sectional study for the analysis of clinical, sexual and laboratory conditions associated to Peyronie's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Although Peyronie's Disease (PD) was first described over 250 years ago, its precise etiology remains obscure.AIM: Analyze a variety of potential associated factors with PD, including erectile dysfunction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 83 consecutive men with PD and 252 age-matched controls. All men completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and were evaluated regarding their clinical and demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and used medications. Anthropometric measures included body mass index and waist circumference (WC). Fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, total testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate were determined.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and laboratory characteristics associated to PD.RESULTS: The mean age was 59.2 + or - 10 years in the cases and 59.7 + or - 12 years in the controls. Marital status, current smoking, and excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages were similar between groups (P &gt; 0.05). PD was more common among white skin color males (P = 0.001). The mean score for each IIEF domain and the androgen levels were similar in the two groups. Thiazides were the only medication associated to PD (P = 0.03). Dupuytren's disease was more frequent among individuals with PD (P = 0.001). The distribution of all other comorbidities investigated was similar between groups (P &gt; 0.05). The characteristics WC &gt; 102 cm and levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) &gt; 130 mg/dL were more prevalent in the controls (P &lt; 0.05). After multivariate analysis, white skin color (OR: 8.47, 95%CI: 1.98-36.24) and thiazide use (OR: 2.29, 95%CI: 1.07-4.90) were associated to PD, and LDL &gt; 130 mg/dL (OR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.32-0.92) and WC &gt; 102 cm (OR: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.29-0.96) were inversely associated to PD.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, PD was more common among white skin colored males. An inverse relationship with the presence of elevated serum levels of LDL and WC was observed. We found no association with medications other than thiazides and comorbidities other than Dupuytren's disease. Androgen serum levels and sexual dysfunction had also no association to PD.",The journal of sexual medicine,19912489,2009
Myofibroblast distribution in Dupuytren's cords: correlation with digital contracture.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's tissue has typically been described as being composed of myofibroblast-rich palmar nodules and relatively acellular tendon-like cords. We aimed to determine myofibroblast distribution (alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA] positive cells) within Dupuytren's tissue and to correlate histologically defined alpha-SMA-positive nodules with digital contracture and recurrent disease.METHODS: One hundred and three digital Dupuytren's cords (72 fasciectomy, 31 dermofasciectomy) were stained with anti-alpha-SMA antibody. The presence of alpha-SMA-positive nodules, their surface area, and alpha-SMA-positive cells were quantified throughout excised Dupuytren's tissue. Clinical data on diathesis, flexion deformity, and previous surgeries were collected.RESULTS: Cords were nodular (66%) or non-nodular (34%). Nodular cords contained 1 (55%), 2 (33%), or 3 or more nodules (12%) composed of localized collections of cells. The mean total nodule surface area was 23 mm(2) (range, 1.3-105 mm(2)). Nodules contained the highest number of alpha-SMA-positive cells (mean 97%, 2374 cells/mm(2)) compared to peri-nodular areas (mean 32%, 763 cells/mm(2)), and more distant cord (mean 8%, 495 cells/mm(2)). Non-nodular cords contained 9% to 17% alpha-SMA-positive cells (mean 475-663 cells/mm(2)), with higher numbers distally. There was greater digital contracture in patients with non-nodular cords. Thirty-six of 38 proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint-marked samples had a nodule that co-localized with the PIP joint. Nodule size did not correlate with flexion deformity or with primary or recurrent disease.CONCLUSIONS: We found that two thirds of digital cords were nodular. Nodules were hypercellular, the majority being alpha-SMA-positive cells. Nodules varied in size and co-localized with the PIP joint. Cord was relatively cellular throughout; a proportion of these cells were alpha-SMA-positive and cells aligned with collagen fibers. Non-nodular cords correlated with significantly greater digital flexion contracture. We propose that cells in nodular cords contract and deposit extracellular matrix components. The matrix is then remodeled in shortened configuration, and as fixed flexion deformity develops, stress shielding eventually leads to myofibroblast apoptosis, and cord becomes less cellular.",The Journal of hand surgery,19910144,2009
The potential roles of cell migration and extra-cellular matrix interactions in Dupuytren's disease progression and recurrence.,"Dupuytren's disease is a pathological condition of the palmar fascia characterized by the formation of contractile disease cords that result in permanent finger contracture. This condition is believed to progress from a myofibroblast-rich nodule in the early clinical stages of the disease to a contractile disease cord spanning a portion of the fascia, leading to contracture of one or more digits. The mechanism(s) by which this disease progresses from a nodule to a collagenous disease cord are poorly understood. Here, we discuss two possible models of disease progression. Firstly, disease progression might be mediated by the proliferation and outward migration of disease cells from within the nodule to populate the adjacent palmar fascia, resulting in a disease cord containing contractile cells derived from the nodule itself. Alternatively, nodular cells may secrete disease-associated factors into the surrounding extra-cellular matrix, thereby altering its composition and triggering quiescent, phenotypically normal cells in the adjacent palmar fascia to take on a proliferative and contractile phenotype. Based on the available evidence and the current state of knowledge of myofibroblast biology, we hypothesize that extra-cellular matrix interactions resulting in conversion of adjacent palmar fascia cells to a disease phenotype is more likely than cell migration from the nodule. Understanding the mechanisms of Dupuytren's disease progression will assist in the development of effective therapeutic interventions to address the high clinical recurrence rate of this condition.",Medical hypotheses,19896280,2009
[Does digital percutaneous fasciotomy in Dupuytren's contracture provokes collateral nerves injuries? 25 cases].,"It is well known that percutaneous fasciotomy must not be realized at the digital level because of the risks of iatrogenic nervous injury. The purpose of this study is to verify if the percutaneous fasciotomy in the digital level is responsible or not for sensory complication by injury of the collateral nerves, thanks to the precise sensory analysis of a series of twenty five palmodigital or digital fasciotomies. Our series included 20 patients operated on between September 2006 and June 2008, as a total of 25 fingers. Only one patient presented preoperative sensory disorders. It was a multi-operated finger. The patients were operated on in one-day surgery by two senior surgeons using percutaneous fasciotomy in the palm and the digit. The analysis of the results consisted in studying at follow-up pain, DASH score, and discriminative sensibility by the static test of Weber, and the test of mono strands of Semmes Weinstein. The postoperative average follow-up was of 10 months. The pain was on average 1.8/10 and the DASH score of 19.77/100. The statistical analysis of the discriminative sensibility showed that there was no significant difference in the average of the results between the hemi-pulp of the operated finger and that of the not operated finger (test of Weber 0.1 &lt; p &lt; 0.5; test of Semmes Weinstein 0.5 &lt; p &lt; 1). A single patient had a bad result at the same time in the Weber and in the Semmes Weinstein. It was a patient operated on several times. Our study shows that the digital percutaneous fasciotomy provokes no sensory disorder. Consequently, it is possible to spread the indications of percutaneous fasciotomy to Dupuytren's contracture in the digital region.",Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,19879030,2009
[Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture; an overview of options].,"In this article we systematically review treatment options for Dupuytren's contracture. There is little evidence on the effectiveness of many treatment modalities for Dupuytren's disease other than expert's opinions (level 4). Most hand surgeons perform selective fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease. Because of its lower recurrence rate, dermofasciectomy is increasingly being performed to treat recurrences. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is a minimally invasive treatment with good short-term results in patients with mild to moderate contractures, but it has a high recurrence rate. Radiotherapy and the use of collagenase are promising, but their role in treating Dupuytren's disease is still unclear.",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,19857298,2009
Quilting of full thickness grafts in the hand.,"A skin graft is the simplest way to reconstruct an area of skin loss. To improve the chance of successful take, shearing forces and haematoma formation between the bed and the graft must be reduced. To achieve this, many surgeons use a tie-over dressing to secure the graft. However, 'quilting' the graft to the wound bed is an alternative method for securing grafts which may be superior to tie-over dressings. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of securing a full thickness graft by tie-over dressing versus quilting in the hand. To do this, we performed a retrospective review of graft-take in a consecutive series of 40 patients undergoing dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease over a five year period. Our results demonstrate no significant difference in graft-take comparing grafts secured with a tie-over dressing or by quilting. Importantly, there were no cases of injury to the tendons or neurovascular structures in those cases where the graft was secured by quilting. Our technique for securing the graft by quilting is less time-consuming compared with a tie-over dressing. Therefore, we no longer use tie-over dressings to secure full-thickness grafts in the hand.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",19853545,2009
Spiralling of the neurovascular bundle in Dupuytren's disease.,"Displacement of the neurovascular bundle within a digit affected by Dupuytren's disease can occur when disease superficial to the neurovascular bundle is connected to disease deep to it. Contraction of such cords results in spiralling of the neurovascular bundle, classically when a pretendinous cord connects with the lateral digital sheet and Grayson's ligament via the oblique cord, but also in association with an isolated digital cord. We describe six cases in which cord formation and contraction resulted in a distal spiral, which may occur in isolation or in combination with a classical proximal spiral, creating a double spiral or corkscrew neurovascular bundle.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",19828565,2009
Upper limb musculoskeletal abnormalities and poor metabolic control in diabetes.,"INTRODUCTION: An increased prevalence of musculoskeletal disease is recognised in diabetes and is a common source of disability. It is known to predominantly affect the upper limbs especially the hand and shoulder. The relationship with other complications of diabetes and glycaemic control is uncertain. We designed this study to clarify these relationships, and to assess differences between types 1 and 2 diabetes.METHODS: We identified a group of 96 people with established diabetes and examined them for the presence of locomotor disease focussing on the upper limbs. We recorded the mean HbA1c and the presence of diabetic complications, together with the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score. We explored correlations between locomotor disease and these variables using logistic regression. We compared data between type 1 and type 2 diabetics and contrasted the amalgamated data with that of a matched control population of medical out patients using Students t tests.RESULTS: Locomotor disease was present in 75% of diabetics with the upper limb the commonest site for abnormalities. This prevalence was significantly higher than that seen in the controls (53%) [p=0.02]. Shoulder capsulitis (25%), carpal tunnel syndrome (20%), tenosynovitis (29%), limited joint mobility (28%) and Dupuytrens contracture (13%) were the most frequent findings and were much commoner than in controls. Capsulitis usually coexisted with other upper limb abnormalities and best predicted the presence of retinopathy and/or neuropathy. The mean HbA1c was significantly higher in patients with combined shoulder and hand problems (9.1%) than in those with no upper limb problems (8.0%) [p=0.018]. The pattern of results was similar in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, although the prevalence of abnormalities and mean HAQ were significantly greater in type 2 patients, which may be in part a function of their greater mean age.CONCLUSION: Upper limb locomotor abnormalities are very common in diabetes and are associated with worse glycaemic control and more diabetic complications. Assessment of upper limb locomotor disease in diabetes should include an estimate of glycaemic control and a search for other complications.",European journal of internal medicine,19818294,2009
Dupuytren's disease: a predominant reason for elective finger amputation in adults.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) can lead to severe disabling finger contractures resistant to surgical treatment. In some cases, finger or ray amputation is considered, due to a severe functional deficit or vascular injury. To evaluate the weight of amputation surgery in DD, a retrospective study was conducted over a 5-year time interval, outlining all indications for elective finger amputation and its prevalence in the total of surgical interventions for DD. The outcome in DD was compared to post-traumatic amputations. Out of 31 elective finger and ray amputations, 12 (39%) were indicated for DD, all in the 4th or 5th ray, of which 92% were in recurrent disease. In the 646 surgical procedures for DD in the matching time interval, we conclude that almost 2% were elective amputations. The outcome of amputation in DD was similar to post-traumatic amputations. Based on these data, we feel that patients should be informed that sometimes, surgical treatment for Dupuytren's disease can lead to an eventual decision to amputate.",Acta chirurgica Belgica,19803262,2009
The role of an MMP inhibitor in the regulation of mechanical tension by Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts.,"Mechanical tension and contracture are two related facets of tissue biology. This study assessed the effect of ilomastat, a broad-spectrum matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor, on generation of tension by Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts. Nodule and cord-derived fibroblasts were isolated from five patients with Dupuytren's disease; flexor retinaculum acted as the control. A culture force monitor (CFM) provided an in vitro model of tissue organization to assess development of mechanical tension, lattice contraction and spatial remodelling by fibroblasts. Responses to ilomastat were compared to treatment with a control peptide. Nodule and cord-derived fibroblasts exhibited a two-fold increase in tension compared with flexor retinaculum. Ilomastat significantly inhibited development of tension by nodule and cord but not flexor retinaculum derived fibroblasts at 100 microM. These results imply that MMP activity mediates regulation of tensile strength by Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts and may be an important therapeutic target in patients with Dupuytren's disease.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",19786408,2009
[Importance of skin graft in preventing recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture].,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of full thickness skin grafts to prevent recurrence of aggressive Dupuytren's contracture.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients presenting with bilateral recurrent Dupuytren's contracture were identified and retrospectively reviewed with a mean follow-up of 8.8 years after dermofasciectomy and skin grafting onto at least one hand.RESULTS: Only two patients presented with a complete diathesis of Dupuytren's contracture, such as defined by Hueston, thus confirming that recurrence is still not predictable. Each patient sustained 3.6 procedures on average. Thirteen patients were skin grafted on a single hand and five patients bilaterally. Recurrence occurred in three instances after skin grafting and in all instances when skin graft was not performed. Finally, three peroperative and five postoperative complications were reported.CONCLUSION: Skin grafting was able to prevent further recurrence of recurrent Dupuytren's contracture in 20 out of 23 hands with more than 8 years of follow-up. Since recurrence is still difficult to predict, primary skin grafting remains controversial. Indications for the procedure are more definite once recurrence has occurred.",Chirurgie de la main,19781973,2009
Injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum for Dupuytren's contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease limits hand function, diminishes the quality of life, and may ultimately disable the hand. Surgery followed by hand therapy is standard treatment, but it is associated with serious potential complications. Injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum, an office-based, nonsurgical option, may reduce joint contractures caused by Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: We enrolled 308 patients with joint contractures of 20 degrees or more in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. The primary metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints of these patients were randomly assigned to receive up to three injections of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (at a dose of 0.58 mg per injection) or placebo in the contracted collagen cord at 30-day intervals. One day after injection, the joints were manipulated. The primary end point was a reduction in contracture to 0 to 5 degrees of full extension 30 days after the last injection. Twenty-six secondary end points were evaluated, and data on adverse events were collected.RESULTS: Collagenase treatment significantly improved outcomes. More cords that were injected with collagenase than cords injected with placebo met the primary end point (64.0% vs. 6.8%, P &lt; 0.001), as well as all secondary end points (P &lt; or = 0.002). Overall, the range of motion in the joints was significantly improved after injection with collagenase as compared with placebo (from 43.9 to 80.7 degrees vs. from 45.3 to 49.5 degrees, P &lt; 0.001). The most commonly reported adverse events were localized swelling, pain, bruising, pruritus, and transient regional lymph-node enlargement and tenderness. Three treatment-related serious adverse events were reported: two tendon ruptures and one case of complex regional pain syndrome. No significant changes in flexion or grip strength, no systemic allergic reactions, and no nerve injuries were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum significantly reduced contractures and improved the range of motion in joints affected by advanced Dupuytren's disease.

Antifibrotic medication using a combination of N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) and ACE inhibitors can prevent the recurrence of Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a progress fibromatosis of unknown origin first described in 1831. Nonoperative treatment options have been suggested involving radiation therapy, vitamin E, local injection therapy suing calcium channel blockers, interferon, corticosteroids or collagenase. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its downstream Smad signalling system is well established as a key player during fibrogenesis. A number of in vitro experiments have been assessed the blockade of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta 2. Clinically, a number of antifibrotic agents are available such as N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC) as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or AT II antagonists. However, to date none of the well known substances has been tested clinically in fibromatosis such as Dupuytren's disease especially to prevent recurrences after surgical release. Antifibrotic medication using a combination of N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) and ACE inhibitor can prevent the recurrence of Dupyutren's disease. Given the fact that recurrence rate in Dupuytren's disease is high and unpredictable after surgical release, an antifibrotic intervention might be worthwhile to consider in the clinical setting. Antifibrotic agents inhibit TGF-beta1, which play a key role in fibromatosis. Thus, antifibrotic medication might reduce the recurrence rate in fibromatosis such as Dupuytren's disease in a clinical significant way.",Medical hypotheses,19726137,2009
[Diabetic osteoarthropathy].,"It is well-known that osteoarthropathy is one of common problems in diabetic patients. Limitation of joint mobility and painful disorder associated with inflammation of tendons and sheaths are more frequently observed on hands and shoulders. Most of these complications are not specific for diabetes mellitus, but more often in diabetic populations than in non-diabetic populations. On the other hand, destructive bone change due to diabetic polyneuropathy are commonly observed on lower extremities. To control neuroarthropathy is important for prevention of the following diabetic ulcer and gangrene. Because diabetic osteoarthropathy is mostly irreversible, early diagnosis is necessary to prevent its progression.",Clinical calcium,19721201,2009
A prospective randomised trial of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures for wound closure after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture.,After fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture the wound has traditionally been closed with non-absorbable sutures. A prospective randomised study of 59 patients was undertaken to compare wound closure after fasciectomy with irradiated polyglactin 910 absorbable sutures and non-absorbable sutures. The outcomes studied were: time spent attending to the wound at the first postoperative visit; the patient's pain score at that visit; and any complications. Wound care required significantly more time when non-absorbable sutures were used. There was no significant difference in pain scores or in complications between the two groups. We recommend the use of irradiated polyglactin 910 absorbable sutures for wound closure after fasciectomy as it saves time and resources without compromising wound healing.,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",19687084,2009
Histological staging and Dupuytren's disease recurrence or extension after surgical treatment: a retrospective study of 124 patients.,"Dupuytren's disease has a high rate of recurrence after treatment. In this study we have assessed the usefulness of histological staging in the prediction of recurrence. We have also verified whether there is a correlation between histological staging and features of Dupuytren's diathesis. We studied 139 hands in 124 Caucasian patients treated between 1997 and 2004. There was a significant difference in the recurrence rate between the three histological types (P = 0.04). Histological staging was independent of features of Dupuytren's diathesis. This study confirms that histological staging is a reliable method for predicting recurrence. However, it should be used in association with clinical data to determine precisely the prognosis of patients suffering from Dupuytren's contracture.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",19675030,2009
The role of skin and subcutaneous tissues in Dupuytren's contracture: an electron microscopic observation.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between the overlying tissues and recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture.METHODS: Forty-three patients (68 hands) who accepted surgical treatment were divided into two groups according to treatment methods: partial fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy and full-thickness skin graft. Diseased palmar fascia, subcutaneous tissues and skin obtained during surgery were then assessed by electron microscopy.RESULTS: All patients were followed up. None of the hands which accepted dermofasciectomy and full-thickness skin grafting recurred, while 46.4% of the hands which accepted partial fasciectomy recurred. Under electron microscopic observation, myofibroblasts were found in the skin and subcutaneous tissues.CONCLUSION: The overlying tissues play an important role in Dupuytren's contracture, which may be a reason for recurrence of this condition after surgical treatment.",Orthopaedic surgery,22009846,2009
"Periostin differentially induces proliferation, contraction and apoptosis of primary Dupuytren's disease and adjacent palmar fascia cells.","Dupuytren's disease, (DD), is a fibroproliferative condition of the palmar fascia in the hand, typically resulting in permanent contracture of one or more fingers. This fibromatosis is similar to scarring and other fibroses in displaying excess collagen secretion and contractile myofibroblast differentiation. In this report we expand on previous data demonstrating that POSTN mRNA, which encodes the extra-cellular matrix protein periostin, is up-regulated in Dupuytren's disease cord tissue relative to phenotypically normal palmar fascia. We demonstrate that the protein product of POSTN, periostin, is abundant in Dupuytren's disease cord tissue while little or no periostin immunoreactivity is evident in patient-matched control tissues. The relevance of periostin up-regulation in DD was assessed in primary cultures of cells derived from diseased and phenotypically unaffected palmar fascia from the same patients. These cells were grown in type-1 collagen-enriched culture conditions with or without periostin addition to more closely replicate the in vivo environment. Periostin was found to differentially regulate the apoptosis, proliferation, alpha smooth muscle actin expression and stressed Fibroblast Populated Collagen Lattice contraction of these cell types. We hypothesize that periostin, secreted by disease cord myofibroblasts into the extra-cellular matrix, promotes the transition of resident fibroblasts in the palmar fascia toward a myofibroblast phenotype, thereby promoting disease progression.",Experimental cell research,19619531,2009
Partial fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contractures.,"One hundred ninety-six patients with Dupuytren's contractures were treated by partial fasciectomy and adequate postoperative rehabilitation.

Digital neuropathy of the median and ulnar nerves caused by Dupuytren's contracture: Case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Digital neuropathy is a pure sensory neuropathy of a digital nerve. It may be caused by acute or chronic local trauma or pressure, or accompany systemic illnesses such as rheumatoid disease, leprosy, Raynaud disease, dysproteinemia, or diabetes mellitus. We describe an extraordinary case of digital neuropathy of the median and ulnar nerves caused by Dupuytren contracture.CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old right-handed man was presented with numbness and tingling of the little finger of the right and ring finger of the left hand. The clinical and EMG findings in this patient were consistent with a lesion of the median and ulnar palmar digital nerves of the right and left ring and little fingers.CONCLUSION: Dupuytren tissue usually affects the palmar fascia, superficial to the digital nerves, and it may rarely affect the spiral cord in the digits. A spiral cord may cause sensory loss due to impingement of digital nerves or Dupuytren tissue may have been compressing the palmar digital nerves against the relatively inelastic deep transverse metacarpal ligament. As a result, digital neuropathy can develop in those with Dupuytren's contracture, and nerve conduction studies should also be performed to determine the condition. New studies are needed to provide better diagnostic criteria for the condition.",The neurologist,19590382,2009

Type-1 Collagen differentially alters beta-catenin accumulation in primary Dupuytren's Disease cord and adjacent palmar fascia cells.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's Disease (DD) is a debilitating contractile fibrosis of the palmar fascia characterised by excess collagen deposition, contractile myofibroblast development, increased transforming growth factor-beta levels and beta-catenin accumulation. The aim of this study was to determine if a collagen-enriched environment, similar to in vivo conditions, altered beta-catenin accumulation by primary DD cells in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor-beta.METHODS: Primary DD and patient matched, phenotypically normal palmar fascia (PF) cells were cultured in the presence or absence of type-1 collagen and transforming growth factor-beta1. beta-catenin and alpha-smooth muscle actin levels were assessed by western immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy.RESULTS: DD cells display a rapid depletion of cellular beta-catenin not evident in patient-matched PF cells. This effect was not evident in either cell type when cultured in the absence of type-1 collagen. Exogenous addition of transforming growth factor-beta1 to DD cells in collagen culture negates the loss of beta-catenin accumulation. Transforming growth factor-beta1-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation, is attenuated by the inclusion of type-1 collagen in cultures of DD and PF cells.CONCLUSION: Our findings implicate type-1 collagen as a previously unrecognized regulator of beta-catenin accumulation and a modifier of TGF-beta1 signaling specifically in primary DD cells. These data have implications for current treatment modalities as well as the design of in vitro models for research into the molecular mechanisms of DD.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,19545383,2009

[The pathobiochemistry of Dupuytren's contracture].,"Dupuytren's contracture is a connective tissue disorder characterized by nodular fibroblastic proliferation of palmar fascia leading to a shortening and progressive digital flexion deformity. It seems that this pathological process is initiated by the differentiation of fibroblast into myofibroblast which has morphologic characteristic of both fibroblast and a smooth muscle cell. Myofibroblasts are able to biosynthesize and secrete growth factors which subsequently bind to the receptors anchored on its surface, bringing about an autocrine and paracrine modality of control cell growth, differentiation and proliferation. It leads to imbalance in the metabolism of extracellular matrix molecules, especially collagen, elastin, fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycan and others, finally damaging mechanical properties of palmar aponeurosis. This rewiev highlights mechanism and many of mentioned factors potentially involved in the development of Dupuytren's disease.",Chirurgia narzadow ruchu i ortopedia polska,19514484,2009
Transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulation enhances Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction in response to uniaxial mechanical load within a 3-dimensional collagen gel.,"PURPOSE: A function of fibroblasts is the generation of cytomechanical force within their surrounding extracellular matrix. Abnormalities in force generation may be the cause of many pathologic conditions including scarring, and some fibroproliferative disorders such as Dupuytren's disease, which is the focus of this report.METHODS: This work investigated the cytomechanical responses of Dupuytren's-derived fibroblasts to externally applied mechanical force using a culture force monitor model, with and without stimulation with the fibrosis-linked cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). We compared these responses with cytomechanical responses of fibroblasts derived from the transverse carpal ligament.RESULTS: Dupuytren's fibroblasts display a significantly greater ability to contract a collagen matrix compared with control fibroblasts, with a maximum generated force of 131 dynes (p &lt; .001). These cells did not exhibit a characteristic plateau phase in the contraction, which indicates a delay in achieving tensional homeostasis from Dupuytren's-derived cells. After being subjected to uniaxial overload and underload, Dupuytren's fibroblasts responded by increased force generation, whereas control fibroblasts responded by a reduction in force in response to an overload, and contraction in response to an underload. These changes were exacerbated by the addition of the profibrotic factor TGF-beta1, with a significant increase in generated force for all cell types, in particular during the early phase of fibroblast attachment and contraction, and a positive contraction gradient in response to overloading forces.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cells derived from this fibrotic disease display characteristic abnormalities in force generation profiles. Their default response to loading or underloading is contraction, or increased force generation. This work highlights the role of TGF-beta1 as a mechano-transduction cytokine, which has an influence on the early phase cell of force generation, as well as a role in mechanical responses of cells to external mechanical stimuli. This, in turn, may influence the progression of Dupuytren's disease and the high rates of recurrence seen postoperatively.",The Journal of hand surgery,19505772,2009

"Keloid scarring, but not Dupuytren's contracture, is associated with unexplained carotid atherosclerosis.","BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis, a response to injury, may be thought of as scarring in the artery wall. TGF-beta and associated signaling molecules have been implicated in the pathophysiology of keloid scarring, Dupuytren's Contracture and atherosclerotic plaques in independent studies.PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that excess cutaneous scarring and Dupuytren's contractures predispose independently to carotid atherosclerosis .METHODS: Among 1,747 patients with plaque measurements and complete data for multivariable regression analysis, 57 Caucasian patients had Dupuytren's contractures and 12 had keloid scars. Carotid total plaque area (TPA) was measured by 2-Dimensional ultrasound.RESULTS: In linear multivariable regression analysis with coronary risk factors, keloid scars were associated with TPA (P= 0.018), but Dupuytren's contractures were not. Patients with keloid scarring were younger (P &lt; 0.0001), and more likely to be diabetic (P &lt; 0.0001)CONCLUSIONS: Keloid scarring is a clinical clue to excess atherosclerosis not explained by traditional risk factors. Such patients may benefit from therapy directed at targets related to signalling molecules common to both the process of keloid scarring and atherosclerosis. These findings suggest previously unexplored possibilities for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. The differences between Dupuytren's and keloid scars that may identify such targets are discussed.",Clinical and investigative medicine. Medecine clinique et experimentale,19331810,2009
"Does a 'firebreak' full-thickness skin graft prevent recurrence after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture?: a prospective, randomised trial.","We randomised 79 patients (84 hands, 90 fingers) with Dupuytren's contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint to have either a 'firebreak' skin graft (39 patients, 41 hands, 44 fingers) or a fasciectomy (40 patients, 43 hands, 46 fingers) if, after full correction, the skin over the proximal phalanx could be easily closed by a Z-plasty. Patients were reviewed after three, six, 12, 24 and 36 months to note any complications, the range of movement and recurrence. Both groups were similar in regard to age, gender and factors considered to influence the outcome such as bilateral disease, family history, the presence of diabetes, smoking and alcohol intake. The degree of contracture of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the operated fingers was similar in the two groups and both were comparable in terms of grip strength, range of movement and disability at each follow-up.

Visual and computer software-aided estimates of Dupuytren's contractures: correlation with clinical goniometric measurements.,"INTRODUCTION: Corrective surgery for Dupuytren's disease represents a significant proportion of a hand surgeon's workload. The decision to go ahead with surgery and the success of surgery requires measuring the degree of contracture of the diseased finger(s). This is performed in clinic with a goniometer, pre- and postoperatively. Monitoring the recurrence of the contracture can inform on surgical outcome, research and audit.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared visual and computer software-aided estimation of Dupuytren's contractures to clinical goniometric measurements in 60 patients with Dupuytren's disease. Patients' hands were digitally photographed. There were 76 contracted finger joints--70 proximal interphalangeal joints and six distal interphalangeal joints. The degrees of contracture of these images were visually assessed by six orthopaedic staff of differing seniority and re-assessed with computer software.RESULTS: Across assessors, the Pearson correlation between the goniometric measurements and the visual estimations was 0.83 and this significantly improved to 0.88 with computer software. Reliability with intra-class correlations achieved 0.78 and 0.92 for the visual and computer-aided estimations, respectively, and with test-retest analysis, 0.92 for visual estimation and 0.95 for computer-aided measurements.CONCLUSIONS: Visual estimations of Dupuytren's contractures correlate well with actual clinical goniometric measurements and improve further if measured with computer software. Digital images permit monitoring of contracture after surgery and may facilitate research into disease progression and auditing of surgical technique.",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,19220942,2009
The lived experience of Dupuytren's disease of the hand.,"AIMS: To describe patients' experiences of living with Dupuytren's disease.BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a chronic, progressive deformity of the hand which limits active extension of the fingers due to advancing and irreversible flexion deformity. It is estimated that two million people are affected by the condition in the UK. Nurses may frequently encounter patients with this condition in a wide range of settings. However, the disease is neglected in the nursing literature and little is known about patients' experience of living with the condition.DESIGN: A phenomenological approach, using Coliazzi's method, was employed.METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six men and one woman diagnosed with Dupuytren's disease.RESULTS: Four interlinking themes emerged. Theme 1: Awareness of Dupuytren's disease describes participants' experiences of recognising and acknowledging the disease, which often did not occur until functional ability was restricted. Theme 2: Living with Dupuytren's disease describes how patients coped with the disease and adapted their activities to maintain independence. Theme 3: Deciding on treatment illuminates how patients decided on treatment and highlights a lack of information and support from health professionals. Theme 4: Receiving treatment articulates participants' experience of surgical treatment and post surgical rehabilitation.CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that people living with Dupuytren's disease receive little information about their condition and possible treatment from health professionals yet high quality and accurate information is required for patients to understand their condition and the treatment options available.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: People with Dupuytren's disease do not always recognise their condition until it has significantly progressed. Following diagnosis they need accurate and up-to-date information about their condition and treatment options. Nurses have an important role to play in raising awareness of the disease, educating patients about its features and progression and enabling them to become active partners in decisions about treatment.",Journal of clinical nursing,19220604,2009
The diabetic hand: a forgotten complication?,"The manifestations of diabetes in the hand were much discussed in the 1970s and 1980s. The present review aims to revisit the diabetic hand and to discuss the pathology of the hand that may be clinically important in diabetic patients. In the strict sense of the term, the &quot;diabetic hand&quot; encompasses the three most widely studied conditions which have traditionally been associated with diabetes, namely limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture and trigger finger. There is evidence that these entities are significantly more frequent in patients with diabetes and also that they may be associated with diabetes duration, poor metabolic control and presence of microvascular complications. In a more general sense, though, there are other conditions affecting the hands, which also occur more frequently in diabetes. From a practical point of view, increased alertness both for neuropathic hand ulcers in patients with profound neuropathy and for diabetic hand infections is absolutely necessary. Recently, reduced hand strength is beginning to be recognized as a further complication of diabetes. Thus, the hand may reveal substantial pathology in diabetes, and ideally, clinical examination should not ignore it.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,19217319,2009
Effect of severity of Dupuytren contracture on disability.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the severity of Dupuytren contracture and disability. The American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines were used to assess the impairment for each involved hand. The disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire was used for evaluating the disability. Eighty patients with 102 involved hands were enrolled. The mean total flexion contracture was 119 degrees /hand or 65 degrees /ray. The mean DASH score was 15 (range 0-69). There was no significant correlation between the DASH score on one hand and the total flexion contracture, the mean flexion contraction/finger, the mean flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP), the mean flexion contracture of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), the number of involved hands, fingers or joints, and the AMA impairment rating on the other hand.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,19153881,2009
Immunohistochemical evidence for Zic1 coexpression with beta-catenin in the myofibroblast of Dupuytren disease.,"The active cellular component in Dupuytren disease (DD) is the alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) containing myofibroblast. The underlying regulatory processes in activation of myofibroblasts resemble the pathophysiology of certain types of cancer. Accumulation of beta-catenin has been shown in many fibroproliferative processes, including DD and, recent findings attributed a possible role to the Zic1 transcription factor. To assess Zic1 expression in DD and investigate its relation with the accumulation of beta-catenin, neighbouring tissue samples in 20 patients with DD were stained immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies for beta-catenin, alpha-SMA, and Zic1. Histological appearance was staged according to Luck. Cell-rich areas with accumulation of beta-catenin in myofibroblasts that stained for alpha-SMA and showed apparent Zic1 coexpression were obvious. This coexpression seemed independent of proliferative or involutional histological staging. We found only Zic1 expression in residual stages. A different pattern of expression of protein in the residual stage may support earlier suggestions of a cellular heterogeneity with the existence of different cell (sub-)populations in nodules and cords. On the other hand coexpression of Zic1 and beta-catenin may indicate a relation between Zic1 and the Wnt-pathway. Further studies are needed to elucidate cellular origin, potential heterogeneity and activity of the myofibroblasts in DD, and to define the exact role of Zic1 in fibroproliferative processes, wound healing, and cancer. The fibroblast in DD is an interesting model for future experiments.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,19153880,2009
"Dupuytren's disease characteristics in Primorsko-goranska County, Croatia.","Dupuytren's disease predominantly occurs among Europeans, with higher reported prevalence in Northern than in Mediterranean European countries. We evaluated the recurrence and extension rates among Caucasian patients from Primorsko-goranska County in Croatia who underwent partial fasciectomy as treatment for Dupuytren's disease. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of diathesis factors on disease progression. Recurrent disease was observed in 68 out of 93 patients (73%). There where 48 (52%) patients with extension of the disease. Differences were found between patients with recurrent disease and those without recurrence regarding age at onset, age at operation and duration of disease. We compared patients younger and older than 50 years at disease onset, and found that older patients had a significantly higher recurrence rate. Characteristics of our patients fit into the picture of typical Dupuytren's disease except for the influence of early age at onset. Among our patients late age at onset proved to be a diathesis factor.",Collegium antropologicum,19149230,2009
The lateral digital flap for Dupuytren's fasciectomy at the proximal interphalangeal joint--a study of 84 consecutive patients.,"Fasciectomy is the most common operation performed for Dupuytren's disease. However, as the joint contracture increases, issues of skin deficiency following release become significant. For severe or recurrent disease dermafasciectomy is advised, but a digital transposition flap provides a viable alternative without the need for a skin graft for less-severe disease with moderate skin deficiency. A retrospective review identified 84 patients who had undergone this operation. The flap used was proximally based on the midlateral aspect of the finger allowing direct closure of the donor site. Ninety hands with 134 digits were operated on and 83% of the patients had a full correction. About 70% remained fully corrected at 1 year. All flaps were performed for proximal interphalangeal joint involvement. The mean pre-operative contracture was 34 degrees, corrected postoperatively to 5 degrees. The recurrence rate was 9%. Two percent of the patients had local infection but no flap necrosis was seen. A lateral digital transposition flap is a very stable operation for Dupuytren's disease with moderate skin deficiency and our patients achieved favourable results when compared to other studies that used local flaps combined with skin graft.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",19129356,2009
Identification of biomarkers in Dupuytren's disease by comparative analysis of fibroblasts versus tissue biopsies in disease-specific phenotypes.,"PURPOSE: Biomarkers are molecular mediators that can serve as indicators of normal biological processes, pathologic processes, and therapeutic interventions. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers in Dupuytren's disease (DD), a fibroproliferative benign tumor with an unknown etiology and high recurrence after surgery.METHODS: Bioinformatic analytical techniques were employed to identify candidate genes that may be differentially expressed in DD, which included gene expression analysis of microarray data and thorough literature searches in genetic linkage and other related biomolecular studies. All DD cases were males with advanced DD (n = 5, 66 years +/- 14). RNA was extracted from biopsies and corresponding cultures of normal fascia (unaffected transverse palmar fascia), palmar nodule and cord from each patient. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions were performed to determine the gene expression levels for disease-related transcripts.RESULTS: The bioinformatic analysis revealed 25 candidate genes, which were further short-listed to 6 genes via functional annotation. The 6 selected candidate genes included: A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM12), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member (ALDH1) A1, Iroquois homeobox protein 6 (IRX6), proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), tenascin C (TNC), and periostin (POSTN). The culturing treatments were shown to have significant impact on the gene expression for ALDH1A1, PRG4, and TNC. In tissue biopsies, significant fold changes were observed for ADAM12, POSTN, and TNC in the cord and/or nodule when compared with that of normal fascia. ADAM12 and POSTN are associated with accelerated or abnormal cell growth, whereas TNC has been associated with fibrotic diseases and cell migration.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated differential gene expression results in DD tissue biopsies compared with that of their corresponding cultures. ADAM12, POSTN, and TNC were identified from the cord and nodule biopsy samples as potential biomarkers in relation to DD development.",The Journal of hand surgery,19121738,2009
Cost minimisation using clinic-based treatment for common hand conditions--a prospective economic analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost of treatment of Dupuytren's disease, ganglia and trigger digits in the out-patient department with the operating theatre.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients seen in a new patient hand clinic with a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease, trigger digit or ganglion of the wrist or hand requiring treatment were prospectively identified over a 6-month period. The numbers undergoing a procedure in the out-patient clinic or theatre were recorded. Costings of theatre time and out-patient time, as well as national tariff income, were obtained from the hospital management.RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 80, 26, and 52 patients were treated with regard to Dupuytren's disease, ganglia and trigger digits, respectively. Of these, 37, 23, and 44 were treated by an out-patient procedure, and 43, 3 and 8 underwent a formal operation. The total cost of the out-patient procedures was calculated at pound 1560 over 6 months. To perform these as formal operations would have cost pound 64,896. The cost savings were, therefore, pound 63,336, or pound 126,672 per annum.CONCLUSIONS: Out-patient interventions for Dupuytren's disease, ganglia and trigger digits result in significant cost savings over formal surgical treatment.",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,19102823,2008
An integrated proteomics approach for studying the molecular pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibromatosis characterized by non-malignant transformation of palmar fascia leading to permanent contraction of one or more fingers. Despite the extensive knowledge of its clinical pathogenesis, the aetiology of this disease remains obscure. In the present paper, we report for the first time on the proteomic profiling of diseased versus unaffected patient-matched palmar fasciae tissues from DD patients using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry analysis. The herein identified proteins were then used to create the protein-protein interaction network (interactome). Such an integrated approach revealed the involvement of several different molecular processes related to DD progression, including extra- and intra-cellular signalling, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal changes, and alterations in cellular metabolism. In particular, autocrine regulation through ERBB-2 and IGF-1R receptors and the Akt signalling pathway have emerged as novel components of pro-survival signalling in Dupuytren's fibroblasts and thus might provide a basis for a new therapeutic strategy in Dupuytren's disease.",The Journal of pathology,19089850,2008
Screening of potential prodrugs on cells derived from Dupuytren's disease patients.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder, the cure for which is still limited to surgical excision of the affected fascia, often leading to high recurrence rates. Due to this fact, non-surgical treatments are being investigated, among them those targeting molecular processes of proliferation and differentiation in Dupuytren's cell cultures. Drugs with antiproliferative action may be valuable in DD treatment. Through characterization of changes on DD-specific cells, we, therefore, decided to test the therapeutic potential of new cytostatic drugs for DD treatment and/or for reduction of post-operative recurrence rates. The N-sulfonylpyrimidine derivative, amidino-substituted benzimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline, and amidino dihydrothienothienyl[2,3-c]quinolone hydrochloride, known to affect proliferation processes, were tested for their antiproliferative activity on primary fibroblasts/myofibroblasts cell cultures derived from the palmar fascia of patients with DD. Only amidino dihydrothienothienyl[2,3-c]quinolone hydrochloride acted in a highly specific manner on cells derived from diseased fascia of DD patients and exhibited a low cytotoxic effect. This result might be a consequence of its specific activity on cytoskeleton changes occurring in differentiating cells. A similar short-term differential antiproliferative effect was observed by the N-sulfonylpyrimidine derivative that was, however, completely lost after 6- and 14-day treatments. The amidino-substituted benzimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline exerted a strong non-specific, dose-related antiproliferative activity on cell types.",Biomedicine &amp; pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine &amp; pharmacotherapie,19010640,2008
Evaluation of activity limitation and digital extension in Dupuytren's contracture three months after fasciectomy and hand therapy interventions.,"STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal Case Series.INTRODUCTION: Dupytren's contracture is thought to result in digital impairments and performance disabilities. No study to date has focused on how patients with Dupuytren's contracture experience limitations in daily activities and the results after surgery.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Describe which activities patients with Dupuytren's contracture defined as the most disabling, how they rated their activity limitations and determine the relationship between activity limitations and digital extension before and three months after surgery and postoperative hand therapy.METHODS: Self-reported rating of activity limitations, performance, and measures of total digital extension.RESULTS: The most disabling activities were with self-care (42%), though overall performance was significantly improved following surgery and postoperative hand therapy. The total digital extension was significantly improved 81 degrees and was positively related to performance.CONCLUSIONS: The results provide new information about activities that patients with Dupuytren's contracture experience as being difficult to perform and describes positive changes in performance and range of motion.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,18986794,2008
Matrix metalloproteinase inhibition reduces contraction by dupuytren fibroblasts.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease is a common fibroproliferative condition of the hand characterized by fibrotic lesions (nodules and cords), leading to disability through progressive digital contracture. Although the etiology of the disease is poorly understood, recent evidence suggests that abnormal matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity may play a role in cell-mediated collagen contraction and tissue scarring. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ilomastat, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, in an in vitro model of Dupuytren fibroblast-mediated contraction.METHODS: Nodule-derived and cord-derived fibroblasts were isolated from Dupuytren patients; carpal ligament-derived fibroblasts acted as control. Stress-release fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCLs) were used as a model of contraction. FPCLs were allowed to develop mechanical stress (48 hours) during treatment with ilomastat (0-100 micromol/L), released, and allowed to contract over a 48-hour period. Contraction was estimated by measuring lattice area compared with untreated cells or treatment with a control peptide. MMP-1, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP levels were assessed by zymography, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Nodule-derived fibroblasts contracted lattices (69% +/- 2) to a greater extent than did cord-derived (55% +/- 3) or carpal ligament-derived (55% +/- 1) fibroblasts. Exposure to ilomastat led to significant inhibition of lattice contraction by all fibroblasts, although a reduction in lattice contraction by nodule-derived fibroblasts was most prominent (84% +/- 8). In addition, treatment with ilomastat led to a concomitant suppression of MMP-1 and MMP-2 activity, whereas MT1-MMP activity was found to be upregulated.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that inhibition of MMP activity results in a reduction in extracellular matrix contraction by Dupuytren fibroblasts and suggest that MMP activity may be a critical target in preventing recurrent contracture caused by this disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,18984345,2008
Beta-catenin overexpression in Dupuytren's disease is unrelated to disease recurrence.,"Recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture is common yet unpredictable, compromising surgical outcome. The alpha-smooth muscle actin-containing myofibroblast is the active contractile cellular component. Based on recent reports on beta-catenin accumulation in Dupuytren's disease, we investigated a possible relation with disease recurrence. We divided a collection of 143 nodules into those from patients with recurrent or nonrecurrent nodules and with a minimal 3-year followup. We randomly selected 12 and 11 samples of each group, respectively. We looked at Dupuytren's diathesis, immunohistologic staining for beta-catenin and alpha-smooth muscle actin, and Luck's histologic stages (zones). The expression of selected Wnt genes was examined with TaqMan PCR in separate histologic zones. All samples showed cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin accumulation in myofibroblasts in involutional zones. The risk score of Abe et al. and Dupuytren's diathesis were greater in the recurrent group. Greater Wnt5a expression in the beta-catenin-accumulating involutional zone was seen. We conclude intracellular beta-catenin accumulation, possibly regulated by upstream Wnt signaling pathway activation and confined in myofibroblasts in the involutional zone of Dupuytren's diathesis, is unrelated to disease recurrence. Clinical parameters for Dupuytren's diathesis remain the best way to predict recurrence risk.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,18958538,2008
The &quot;Jacobsen Flap&quot; for the treatment of stages III-IV Dupuytren's disease: a review of 98 cases.,"The treatment of severe Dupuytren's disease of the little finger is controversial: several techniques have been described with variable reported results and postoperative complications. This paper reviews 98 cases that underwent surgery between 2001 and 2006 using the Jacobsen flap procedure, a modification of the McCash technique. We found this technique relatively simple and it allowed significant correction of the contracture, with a low rate of complication. We believe this is an excellent alternative to dermofasciectomy or amputation.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",18936123,2008
[Dupuytren's contracture: surgery is no longer necessary].,"Dupuytren contracture or disease of the hand is the retraction of the palmar aponeurosis. Its course is progressive and leads to an irreducible flexion deformity of one or more fingers. Early diagnosis is necessary for the table test, which determines the need for treatment. Needle aponeurotomy should be the first option treatment. This minimally invasive outpatient procedure minimizes sick leave and does not require immobilization or physical therapy. Several studies confirmed the short- and intermediate-term effectiveness of this treatment and the minimal side effects when performed by experienced operators. Multiple procedures for extensive disease (several knots) can be performed in the hospital. Close medical and surgical collaboration is necessary for treatment of severe forms, treatment failures, and multiple recurrences.","Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",18922672,2008
[Etiology of Dupuytren's contracture].,"Dupuytren's contracture is a connective tissue disorder characterized by contractile palmar aponeurosis leading to shortening and progressive digital flexion deformity. Various investigators have proposed many theories and documented several findings regarding the aetiology of Dupuytren's contracture. However, none of them explains the causes well enough. Most studies have found relationships between the disorder and manual labor, previous hand injures, genetic susceptibility, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, high cholesterol level profile and intake of either alcohol or tobacco. However, according to others, the evidence on risk factors associated with certain lifestyles has been conflicting. This article reviews the most common theories regarding the aetiology of Dupuytren's contracture such as genetic, microinjury, immunological, toxic and ischaemic theories.",Chirurgia narzadow ruchu i ortopedia polska,18847012,2008
A survey of clinical manifestations and risk factors in women with Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is very common, with a prevalence of up to 40% in the Scandinavian population. Although many epidemiological surveys have been conducted, little is known about its aetiology. Multiple risk factors in Dupuytren's disease have been identified. About 80% of the affected patients are male. Even though recent data suggest similar outcome after surgical treatment in the female patient, recurrence after surgery is more frequent. To assess Dupuytren's disease in women, a record analysis and a survey of risk factors was conducted in 130 female patients surgically treated at our institution between 1988 and 2005. With a response rate of 52%, 65 women were included (6 patients were confirmed dead). The mean age of onset of the disease was 50 years and 6 months. After a mean follow-up of 7 years and 7 months (2y1m to 21y9m), recurrent disease after surgery was reported in 42%. Bilateral disease was present in 54%, unilateral in 26% right and 20% left hands. The fifth finger was involved in 77%, the 4th finger in 48% and the 1st ray in 14%. Ectopic lesions were seen in 19%, with a positive family history in 55%. Only one patient had a confirmed alcohol abuse; 22% were smokers. There were 32% manual workers. Shoulder pain was present in 54% of the patients, with confirmed diagnosis of frozen shoulder syndrome in 45%. High cholesterol was diagnosed in 39% and only 6% had diabetes. Epilepsy was seen in 5%. High disease recurrence and factors related to an aggressive course of the disease are present in female patients with Dupuytren's contracture, with a high family history occurrence, bilateral disease and associated Ledderhose disease. Several known risk factors were present: high cholesterol, smoking and manual work. Frozen shoulder showed a very high prevalence in women with Dupuytren's disease.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,18811027,2008
Nonoperative treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Many approaches to nonoperative treatment of Dupuytren's disease have been tried since the disease was originally described in 1831, and most have been abandoned. Nonetheless, the appeal for nonoperative methods persists, in pursuit of lower morbidity and lesser complications than may be encountered with open surgical treatment. A number of nonoperative treatment modalities are in current use for Dupuytren's disease, despite lack of high-level clinical studies supporting these methods. Some of these can be utilized as an adjunct to surgical treatment rather than a replacement for it. The most commonly used nonoperative treatment methods are briefly reviewed.",The Journal of hand surgery,18762122,2008
Metalloproteinase gene expression correlates with clinical outcome in Dupuytren's disease.,"PURPOSE: We have previously demonstrated that gene expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), related metalloproteinases &quot;a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospontin motifs&quot; (ADAMTSs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) differed when comparing palmar fascia from 19 patients with Dupuytren's disease (DD) with 19 disease-free controls. We undertook to investigate whether the extent of this altered gene expression was related to clinical outcome.METHODS: All the patients with DD were followed up for an average of 14 months from their primary fasciectomy. Clinical outcome was scored by measuring range of motion to assess total extension deficit (fixed flexion deformity [FFD] of the affected digit), total further flexion, and grip strength, and using 3 validated outcome scores: the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), and the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS).RESULTS: We found a considerable correlation between levels of gene expression of several of the MMPs (MMP2, MMP13, MMP14, MMP16, MMP 19) and ADAMTSs (ADAMTS2, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, ADAMTS14, ADAMTS16) and the recurrence of FFD over the follow-up period. The expression of all these genes had been shown to be increased in DD samples compared with controls. We also found that the expression levels of several of these genes correlated with 2 other preoperative measurements, total further flexion (digital roll-up) and grip strength.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that gene expression levels of key MMPs and ADAMTSs could be used to predict 1-year clinical outcome in terms of recurrent FFD of the affected finger following fasciectomy for DD. This implies that knowledge of these expression levels could be used to direct appropriate surgical and adjuvant intervention for DD. This study also provides further evidence to support the functional link between metalloproteinase gene expression and symptomatic progression or recurrence.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.",The Journal of hand surgery,18762113,2008
Expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in cords and nodules of patients with Dupuytren's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by thickening of the palmar fascia. Several studies indicate that MMPs and TIMPs may play a key role in the onset or progression of Dupuytren's disease and related disorders. In this study, we used a quantitative reverse-transcription PCR methodology to profile the expression of TIMP1, TIMP2, MMP2, and MMP9 in nodule and cord tissue from patients with Dupuytren's disease and compared this with normal palmar fascia taken at carpal tunnel release.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue from patients with Dupuytren's disease was taken at fasciectomy (n = 30; 23 men and 7 women; average age 61.3 +/- 9.5 years). Samples were divided into regions of nodule and cord according to gross morphology. Normal fascia was taken from patients without Dupuytren's contracture who had carpal tunnel release (n = 30; 14 men and 16 women; average age 63 +/- 11 years). Expression of mRNA was calculated using a relative quantification method (Pfaffl). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. The level of significance was considered to be P &lt; 0.05.RESULTS: In comparison to normal fascia, the cords and nodules from patients with Dupuytren's disease showed significant upregulation for TIMP1 and TIMP2 (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of TIMP1 was significantly higher in nodules in comparison to cord tissue (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of MMP2 was significantly upregulated in tissue of patients with Dupuytren's contracture in comparison to normal tissue (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of MMP2 was significantly higher in nodules in comparison to cord tissue (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the relative expression of MMP9 in nodules and cord tissue of patients with Dupuytren's contracture in comparison to normal fascia from patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.CONCLUSIONS: The balance between MMPs and their natural inhibitors is disturbed in patients with Dupuytren's disease. The decrease in MMP-to-TIMP expression can cause increased synthesis and deposition of collagen, leading to palmar fibromatosis. The high expression of MMP2 may represent an unsuccessful attempt to reduce collagen deposition. In the future, a treatment that downregulates TIMPs but increases the activity of MMPs may be an appropriate therapy for Dupuytren's disease.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,18758795,2008
Positive association of HLA-DRB1*15 with Dupuytren's disease in Caucasians.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a permanent nodular condition affecting the palms and digits of the hands, leading to progressive shortening and contractures of the digits often resulting in diminished function and severe deformity. DD is thought to be one of the most common hereditary connective tissue disorders in Caucasians. To elucidate further the aetiology of DD, we compared the HLA-DRB1 phenotype frequencies of DD patients (n=67) against the HLA-DRB1 phenotype frequencies observed in a control population (n=537). HLA-DRB1*15 phenotype frequency was higher in DD positive Caucasoids (37.3%) when compared with control data (20.9%) (corrected P=0.029): we conclude that in Caucasoids of European origin, HLA-DRB1*15 is associated with risk of developing DD.",Tissue antigens,18721277,2008
Gene expression analysis of Dupuytren's disease: the role of TGF-beta2.,"Dupuytren's disease is characterised by nodular fibroblastic proliferation of the palmar fascia leading to contracture of the hand. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is thought to play a role in its pathogenesis. We performed a cDNA microarray analysis of Dupuytren's diseased cord tissue with an emphasis on TGF-beta isoforms. Normal-appearing transverse ligament of the palmar fascia from adjacent to the diseased cord and palmar fascia from patients undergoing carpal tunnel release were used as controls. TGF-beta gene expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Over 20 unique genes were found to be significantly up-regulated, including several previously reported genes. A dominant increase in TGF-beta2 expression was seen in the cord tissue, whereas TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3 were found not to be significantly up-regulated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed these findings. This gene expression profile allows for further experiments that may eventually lead to gene therapy to block the development and progression of Dupuytren's disease clinically.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",18694919,2008
[Wet environmental cure for Dupuytren pathology. Evaluation and follow-up].,"Dupuytren disease starts with a fracture in the hand which in most cases requires surgery. In the Galdakao Hospital during 2006 and early 2007, medical personnel carried out a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a Aquacel wet cure dressing (Hydrofiber Technology, ConvaTec, Bristol-Myers Squibb) in treatment for secondary wounds after surgery to deal with Dupuytren pathology. 52 patients who underwent surgery for Dupuytren pathology were included in this study, in stages from N to IV, using surgical techniques Skoog and Skoog and McCash. Average patient age was 62.8 (range 29-79); 43 (82.7%) were male. Perilesional skin condition improved in 100% of the cases after the use of this dressing. Average time for complete cicatrisation was 2.7 weeks (DE 1.04). Initial pain sensation tied to the wound had a 4.9 average score (evaluated according to an analogical pain scale from 1 to 10). After cure sessions with this dressing, a 1.8 score was registered (for pain reduction of 63%). Adaptation and ease of application of this dressing received an excellent rate in 47 cases or 90.4% and a good rate in 4 cases, or 9.6%. Comfort sensation was rated as excellent by 48 patients, or 92.3% and good by 4 patients, or 7.7%. Removal of this dressing was rated as excellent in 33 cases, or 63.5% and good in 19 cases, or 36.5%.

Dupuytren's palmar contracture in women.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia that can cause disabling digital contractures. The pathogensis of the disease is still unclear, and it afflicts predominantly white males of northern European origin. Gender-related differences of Dupuytren's disease and the distinctive characteristics of the disease in females are not yet well defined.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and illustrate the distinctive characteristics of Dupuytren's disease in females.METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of all female patients with Dupuytren's disease seen and followed at our Hand Surgery Unit over a 20 year period. The study group consisted of 48 women (56 hands). The collected data included clinical and epidemiological features on admission, and outcome of surgical intervention.RESULTS: Of the 48 women (56 hands) with Dupuytren's disease, 23 (26 hands) underwent limited fasciectomy. The average age at presentation was 60.1 years. A few of the patients originated from Asia and Africa. Manifestations and pattern of the disease were nearly comparable to those observed in the male group, except for a slightly higher incidence of proximal interphalangeal joint contracture in female patients. Generally, females expressed less severe contractures on presentation and a slower progression thereafter. A favorable functional postoperative outcome was observed. Seven patients had minor complications including local hematoma and painful scars. Two patients developed moderate signs of complex regional pain syndrome.CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are needed to assess the potential role of androgens in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease, and a possible protective role of estrogenic hormones, rendering Dupuytren's contracture a postmenopausal affliction.",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,18669144,2008
Reverse thenar perforator flap for volar hand reconstruction.,"The glabrous skin of the palm provides the best colour and texture match for reconstructing volar hand defects, but only a limited number of local axial pattern flaps of the palm have been described in the literature. This report describes a new reverse thenar perforator flap harvested from the midpalm and the thenar region. A total of 12 patients with volar hand defects of the index finger, palm, or first web space were reconstructed with this flap between August 2005 and August 2007. The causes of the defects were trauma (one patient), burn contracture release of the first web and index finger (four patients), and Dupuytren contracture release (seven patients). The flap was supplied from one or two of the perforating branches of the terminal branch of the superficial palmar arch or the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. Flap sizes ranged from 1.5 x 3.0 cm to 2.5 x 6.5 cm. The donor sites were repaired primarily in all patients. There were no major postoperative problems: 11 flaps out of 12 survived completely with just one partial loss. Excellent functional and cosmetic results were observed during a mean follow up of 12.6 months. The reverse thenar perforator flap offers glabrous skin for defects of the palm, first web and index finger. Donor scarring of the flap is minimal and it is suitable for the 'replacement with similar tissue' concept.","Journal of plastic, reconstructive &amp; aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",18667372,2008
Clinical effectiveness of post-operative splinting after surgical release of Dupuytren's contracture: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Splinting after contracture release for Dupuytren's disease of the hand is widely advocated. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the quantity and quality of evidence regarding the effectiveness of splinting in the post-surgical management of Dupuytren's contractures.METHODS: Studies were identified by searching the electronic databases Medline, AMED, CINAHL and EMBASE. Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: prospective or retrospective, experimental, quasi-experimental or observational studies investigating the effectiveness of static or dynamic splints worn day and/or night-time for at least 6 weeks after surgery and reporting either individual joint or composite finger range of motion and/or hand function. The methodological quality of the selected articles was independently assessed by the two authors using the guidelines for evaluating the quality of intervention studies developed by McDermid.RESULTS: Four studies, with sample sizes ranging from 23 to 268, met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Designs included retrospective case review, prospective observational and one controlled trial without randomisation. Interventions included dynamic and static splinting with a mean follow-up ranging from 9 weeks to 2 years. Pooling of results was not possible due to the heterogeneity of interventions (splint type, duration and wearing regimen) and the way outcomes were reported.CONCLUSION: There is empirical evidence to support the use of low load prolonged stretch through splinting after hand surgery and trauma, however only a few studies have investigated this specifically in Dupuytren's contracture. The low level evidence regarding the effect of post-operative static and dynamic splints on final extension deficit in severe PIP joint contracture (&gt;40 degrees ) is equivocal, as is the effect of patient adherence on outcome. Whilst total active extension deficit improved in some patients wearing a splint there were also deficits in composite finger flexion and hand function. The lack of data on the magnitude of this effect makes it difficult to interpret whether this is of clinical significance. There is a need for well designed controlled trials with proper randomisation to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of splinting following Dupuytren's surgery.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,18644117,2008
[Clinical results of terminolateral neurorrhaphy in digital nerves].,"In end-to-side-neurorrhaphy the collateral sprouting of axons has been proven in many animal studies. It has not yet been determined if a satisfactory sensory recovery occurs. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of well documented clinical studies. We have used end-to-side nerve sutures in five patients. Four of them showed gaps in digital nerves, the fifth patient had a partial transsection of the superficial branch of the radial nerve. At the time of follow-up examination, surgery had been performed an average of 21 months previously (11 - 39 months). We examined sensibility, temperature perception, patient satisfaction and the presence of pain and neuroma. Two of the patients with injured digital nerves reached an almost normal two-point discrimination of 6 mm, the other two patients only achieved a value &gt; 10 mm. With monofilaments one patient was able to recognise the 3.61 filament, which constitutes a standard value. The other three recognised the 4.31 filament, which is only one degree less. All measurements concerning the superficial branch of the radial nerve turned out to be less satisfactory, however, one must consider that the sensation qualitiy in this area is less to begin with. No neuromas occurred, except in the case of the radial nerve. None of the patients showed full recovery of temperature perception. Two were able to recognise a warm and three a cold probe head. Our results confirm the findings made in other studies which also found a clinical correlate to collateral axonal sprouting. Unfortunately results are still inconsistent.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",18633887,2008
Asymptomatic palmar pits: clinical evaluation of six cases and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Palmar pits are intriguing and are found in association with diverse dermatologic conditions. Some are innocuous, whereas others have sinister implications.OBJECTIVE: Six cases of asymptomatic palmar pits are described, and the literature is reviewed in brief.METHOD AND RESULTS: Of the six patients, five were male and one was female, with a mean age of 63.5 years. In all six patients, the palmar pits were noticed incidentally during a cutaneous examination for some other unrelated dermatoses, except in one in whom the pits were the reason for visiting a dermatologist. The number of pits varied from one to nine. Dupuytren contracture was observed in five patients. Sole involvement was seen in only one patient. None had overlying hyperkeratosis or associated symptoms relating to palmar pits.CONCLUSIONS: Palmar pits may have sinister implications in conditions such as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or Cowden syndrome. The association of palmar pits and Dupuytren contracture seems to be common but is underreported. Palmar pits may be the clinical cutaneous sign of systemic diseases and may sometimes provide a diagnostic clue to other dermatoses. This report emphasizes the significance of the art of clinical observation in dermatology.",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,18627702,2008

A clinical analysis of Dupuytren's disease of the thumb.,"Although Dupuytren's disease of the thumb was first described in 1833, the literature on this subject is limited to a few anatomical and clinical studies. This study examined the pattern of cords of Dupuytren's disease in 260 thumbs in 181 consecutive patients with evidence of disease relating to the thumb attending an out-patient clinic over a period of 36 months. Discrepancies in the literature are discussed in the light of the findings of this more detailed analysis and a simple but practical pictorial system for recording disease severity and detailing progression over time is presented.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",18562356,2008
Results of total aponeurectomy for Dupuytren's contracture in 61 patients: a retrospective clinical study.,"INTRODUCTION: Many surgical techniques have been advocated to treat Dupuytren's contracture. Partial fasciectomy is often performed to treat the whole spectrum of Dupuytren's disease.METHOD: We have reviewed the effectiveness of total aponeurectomy performed on 61 patients [10 women and 51 men (male:female ratio 5.1:1) with a mean age of 63.0 (range 42-79 years) and a mean follow-up of 3.45 years (range 1.03-6.39 years)].RESULTS: Post-operative complications including haematoma, seroma or necrosis were found in 13.8% of the patients. Recurrence of contracture occurred in 10.8% of the patients and 4.6% of the operated patients presented with a nerve lesion. Nerve irritation occurred in 6.2% of the patients. The mean DASH-score was 3.85 (range 0-52.5). Family pre-disposition was an important risk factor for Dupuytren's disease with 44.3% of patients having a positive family history.CONCLUSION: We suggest that total aponeurectomy is a promising alternative to partial fasciectomy with low risk for a recurrence and slightly increased risk for a nerve lesion.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,18516613,2008
No gene copy number changes in Dupuytren's contracture by array comparative genomic hybridization.,"Dupuytren's contracture (DC), a benign disease of unknown origin, is characterized by abnormal fibroblast proliferation and matrix deposition within the palmar and plantar faciae, causing contracture of the digits. Conventional cytogenetic studies of cultured fibroblast cells from DC nodules have revealed nonrecurrent, but usually normal, clonal (mainly +7, +8, and -Y, plus structural changes) and sporadic (nonclonal) numerical/structural rearrangements. No unique cytogenetic features of DC are known so far. We used 44K oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization to obtain a wide pattern of chromosomal imbalances in 18 patients with DC. The genome-wide analysis revealed no changes of DNA copy number sequences. Accordingly, gene amplifications or deletions are apparently not involved in the progression of abnormal fibroblast proliferation and matrix deposition that lead to DC.",Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,18474290,2008
Needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's contracture.,"PURPOSE: To review the efficacy and safety of needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's contracture in Chinese patients.METHODS: Seven men and one woman aged 50 to 80 (mean, 67) years underwent needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's contracture. Five were manual workers and the other 3 were retired. Their chief complaints were difficulty moving the fingers, clumsiness of the hand, and occasional pain in the palm. No patient had any family history of Dupuytren's contracture.RESULTS: 41 points were released in 13 fingers (3 middle, 3 ring, and 7 little). Immediately after release, the respective mean flexion contracture correction of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints were 50 (from 50 to 0) and 35 (from 46 to 11) degrees. At 22-month follow-up, the respective mean residual flexion contracture of both joints were 12 and 27 degrees; the corresponding long-term improvements were 70 and 41%. No patient had a wound complication or neurovascular injury. All had a normal score for Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand.CONCLUSION: For Chinese patients with Dupuytren's contracture, needle aponeurotomy is safe and effective. Long-term correction is better maintained in metacarpophalangeal than proximal interphalangeal joints (70 vs 41%).",Journal of orthopaedic surgery (Hong Kong),18453667,2008
"Splinting after contracture release for Dupuytren's contracture (SCoRD): protocol of a pragmatic, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Splinting as part of the overall post-surgical management of patients after release of Dupuytren's contracture has been widely reported, though there is variation in practice and criteria for using it. The evidence on its effectiveness is sparse, of poor quality and contradictory with studies reporting negative and positive effects.DESIGN: A multi-centre, pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial is being conducted to evaluate the effect of static night splinting for six months on hand function, range of movement, patient satisfaction and recurrence at 1 year after fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy. Using a centrally administered computer randomization system consented patients will be allocated to one of two groups: i) splint group who will be given a static splint at approximately 10 to 14 days after surgery to be worn for 6 months at night time only as well as hand therapy; ii) non-splint group, who will receive hand therapy only. The primary outcome measure is the patient-reported Disabilities of the Arm, Hand and Shoulder Questionnaire (DASH). Secondary outcomes are total active flexion and extension of fingers, patient satisfaction and recurrence of contracture. Outcome measures will be collected prior to surgery, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Using the DASH as the primary outcome measure, where a difference of 15 points is considered to be a clinically important difference a total of 51 patients will be needed in each group for a power of 90%. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used.DISCUSSION: This pragmatic randomized controlled trial will provide much needed evidence on the clinical effectiveness of post-operative night splinting in patients who have undergone fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture of the hand.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 57079614.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,18447898,2008

We describe the case of a 27 years old caucasian male with initial diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease. He underwent palmar fascia surgery, but the surgical treatment was followed by recurrence of the deformity in retraction of 4th and 5th finger of the left hand. When he presented himself at our attention, the patient underwent surgical biopsy and new histological examination was made with diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma. We highlight essentially two aspects of this case: the diagnostic delay of tumour caused by simulation of the Dupuytren's disease and the atypical perineural spread along the median nerve.",Il Giornale di chirurgia,18419978,2008
MOC-PS(SM) CME article: Dupuytren's disease.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After reviewing this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe the condition of Dupuytren's disease in its various presentations and severity. 2. Describe the pathologic anatomy involved in palmar and digital contractures. 3. Understand recent elucidation of relevant pathophysiology. 4. Be familiar with treatment options and the management of complications.SUMMARY: Dupuytren's contracture is one of the most frequent conditions seen by practicing hand surgeons. Inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, the disease is characterized by a nodular thickening of the palmar fascia metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. Treatment is offered to symptomatic patients with painful nodular or disabling contracture. The most prevalent surgical procedure is limited fasciectomy of the involved abnormal structures. Recurrence is common. New treatments on the horizon include the injection of clostridial collagenase, which is now in U.S. Food and Drug Administration phase III trials.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,18379378,2008

Molecular phenotypic descriptors of Dupuytren's disease defined using informatics analysis of the transcriptome.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis, which may cause progressive, permanent contracture of digits. Previous studies provide compelling evidence that genetic alterations play an important role. Macroscopically affected areas demonstrate phenotypic differences between the two structurally distinct fibrotic elements in DD (ie, the nodule and the cord). In this study, we set out to (1) compare gene expression profiles between DD and transverse carpal fascia of control subjects (external control); (2) profile DD cords and nodules from the palm against the unaffected transverse palmar fascia (internal control); and (3) identify biologically important candidate genes from the transcriptome profiles.METHODS: RNA samples from DD nodules (n = 4), cords (n = 4), and internal control (n = 4) as well as external control (n = 4) from unaffected individuals were subjected to differential gene expression profile analysis. Changes of more than 2-fold in DD groups and controls were recorded. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were performed to validate 16 implicated genes, which included developmental control genes, matrix metalloproteinases, and apoptotic genes.RESULTS: Several genes associated with DD formation were common across all 6 pairwise analyses. Genes markedly upregulated shared common expression levels across all pairwise analysis studies. Pairs involving the DD nodule arrays were notably distinguishable from all other permutations. The majority of genes dysregulated in the DD cords demonstrated an increase in fold change when compared with the DD nodule tissues. Key collagens, collagenases, metalloproteinases, and inhibitors were identified. Genes involved in cytoskeleton development and lipid metabolism were markedly dysregulated. Confirmations of these alterations were obtained in quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a gradation in expression of certain genes in DD tissue phenotypes compared with control fascia. Transcriptome profiling is predictive not only of disease but also of disease phenotype. These results indicate a number of important candidate genes associated with DD formation, which may provide clues for molecular mechanisms involved in DD pathogenesis.",The Journal of hand surgery,18343292,2008
Lack of association of iron metabolism and Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Iron accumulation as seen in genetic haemochromatosis is a major cause of hepatic fibrogenesis. A link between chronic liver disease and Dupuytren's disease (DD) is well established, especially in alcoholics.AIM: The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that iron accumulation might cause fibrosis of the palmar aponeurosis leading to DD.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined iron metabolism, mutations of the HFE gene, serum cholesterol, alcohol consumption, presence of chronic liver disease, diabetes and history of severe manual work in a group of 90 patients who had undergone surgery for a severe form of DD. The tissue removed during surgery was histologically examined to confirm the diagnosis of DD. For a control group, we used 33 healthy subjects with similar profiles.RESULTS: The DD group consisted of 82 men and 8 women. Chronic liver disease was found in 27% of DD patients, compared with 6.1% of control subjects (P = 0.013). A history of hand traumatization was present in 33% of DD patients vs. 15% of control subjects (P = 0.048). Excessive alcohol consumption was present in 35.5% of DD patients compared with 15.1% of controls (P = 0.029). None of the other tested parameters, including the prevalence of HFE gene mutations, showed a significant difference between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Iron accumulation does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of DD. However, sex, age, manual labour and alcohol consumption are risk factors for progression of DD. We observed a high incidence of chronic liver disease in patients with DD.",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,18194242,2008
Perforator-based forearm island flap.,"Reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the hand with exposed tendons, nerves, joints and bones could be quite a challenge for the surgeon. Only adequate coverage can save their functions. In our case we present a patient with adduction contracture of the right thumb after II degree burns, treated with perforator-based forearm flap. This flap relies only on perforating branches (5 to 11 in number) arising from the radial artery and located proximal to the radial styloid (2 to 7 cm). The main advantages of this method are that it is a single-stage operative technique, it is applicable in emergency conditions, and the main artery is spared. The cosmetic effect of the donor site could be considered a disadvantage of this approach.",Acta chirurgiae plasticae,19263644,2008

[Dupuytren's contracture limited to the distal interphalangeal joint--a case report].,"A case of Dupuytren's contracture involving only the distal interphalangeal joint of the right little finger is reported. The contracture developed gradually during 6 months, after a minor trauma of this finger. Distal phalanx was fixed in 60 degrees flexion in the distal and 30 degrees flexion in the proximal interphalangeal joints, but it did not disturbed patient's normal daily activity. Proximal interphalangeal flexion was easy reducible, but distal phalanx was settled in fixed flexion deformity. No pathology was seen in the palmar aspect of the midhand. At the exploration, a thickened 1 cm long cord localised at the radial side of the distal interphalangeal joint and extending across this joint was identified, and excised. This resulted in full correction of the flexion deformity. Histopathological examination revealed excised cord to be a fibrous tissue, typical for the Dupuytren's contracture.",Chirurgia narzadow ruchu i ortopedia polska,18092701,2007

Dupuytren's contracture in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus--a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture is one of the manifestations of the hand syndrome in diabetes mellitus (DM). Its occurrence in diabetes mellitus is not commonly reported in this environment. This report aims to highlight the occurrence of Dupuytren's contracture as a rare manifestation of diabetic hand syndrome in a patient with type 2 DM.METHOD: The case note of a patient with type 2 DM who developed Dupuytren's contracture in both hands and the available literature on the subject were reviewed.RESULT: A 62-year-old Nigerian male Islamic Cleric with type 2 DM for sixteen years on follow-up at the Diabetes clinic of the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), Jos, developed flexion deformity involving both palms. His symptoms had progressed gradually over the preceding nine months before presentation. Physical examination revealed bilateral Dupuytren's contracture of the palms with hyperkeratosis and flexion deformities of the fingers. He was admitted to the surgical ward of JUTH and had surgery in the right hand. He is to have surgery in the left hand on a later date.CONCLUSION: Dupuytren's contracture is a rare presentation of diabetic hand syndrome.

Dermatan sulfate remodeling associated with advanced Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dermatan sulfate (DS) widespread as a component of extracellular matrix proteoglycans, is characterized by great bio-reactivity and remarkable structural heterogeneity due to distinct degrees of sulfation and glucuronosyl epimerization and different polymerization degrees. However, DS metabolism under various biological conditions is poorly known. Dupuytren's contracture is a benign fibromatosis leading to complex remodeling of the palmar fascia structure and properties. However, it remains unclear whether the disease affects the structure of DS, which is the major tissue glycosaminoglycan. Thus the aim of the study was to examine the structure of the total DS in Dupuytren's fascia. DS chains were extracted from 5 samples of normal fascia and 7 specimens of Dupuytren's tissue by papain digestion followed by fractionation with cetylpyridinium chloride. Then, DS structure analysis was performed comprising the evaluation of its molecular masses and sensitivity to hyaluronidase and chondroitinase B. Dupuytren's contracture is associated with significant remodeling of DS chain structure revealed by (1) a distinct profile of chain molecular masses characterized by the appearance of long size components as well as the increase in the content of small size chains; (2) a different glucuronosyl epimerization pattern connected with the enhanced content of glucuronate disaccharide blocks; (3) chain oversulfation. These structural alterations in total DS may modify the GAG interactions especially affecting collagen fibrillogenesis and growth factor availability. Thus, Dupuytren's contracture associated DS remodeling may promote the phenomena typical for advanced disease: apoptosis and reduction in cell number as well as the appearance of dense pseudotendinous collagen matrix.",Acta biochimica Polonica,18066404,2007
Dupuytren's disease: personal factors and occupational exposure.,"BACKGROUND: The etiology of Dupuytren's disease is unknown, and the role of occupational exposure is still debated. Our objective was to study the association between occupational exposures, personal risk factors and Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, nine occupational physicians performed clinical examinations, focused on Dupuytren's disease, of 2,406 French male civil servants employed at the Equipment Ministry in 1998 and interviewed them about medical history, leisure manual exposure and occupational biomechanical exposure to vibrations and manual work. A cumulative occupational exposure score was defined, with three levels of exposure.RESULTS: Dupuytren's disease was diagnosed in 212 men (8.8%). The occupational exposure score was significantly higher in this group of cases than in the rest of the sample (377 (SD280) vs. 223 (SD250), respectively; P &lt; 0.0001). Occupational exposure was associated with Dupuytren's disease (adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.20 [1.39-3.45] for the intermediate and 3.10 [1.99-4.84] for the high exposure groups), with adjustment for age, leisure physical activities, alcohol consumption (&gt; or =5 servings per day), history of diabetes, epilepsy, hand trauma, and familial history of Dupuytren's disease.CONCLUSION: Manual work exposure was associated with Dupuytren's disease after adjustment for personal risk factors.

Enhanced alpha 1(I) mRNA expression in frozen shoulder and dupuytren tissue.,"The purpose of this study has been to investigate collagen I and III synthesis during the fibrosing stage of frozen shoulder and Dupuytren samples in comparison to normal capsule tissue. - By using the quantitative PCR significantly increased levels of alpha 1(I) mRNA transcription in samples of frozen shoulder (p = 0.016) and Duypuytren (p = 0.041) could be demonstrated, whereas alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) chains have shown the same mRNA levels as in normal capsule tissue. - Despite an enhancement of alpha 1(I) mRNA transcription in frozen shoulder and Dupuytren samples the intracellular precursor procollagen I and extracellular mature collagen I was detected immunohistochemically in reduced levels. - The structural alteration of collagen I assembly might be caused by disturbed post-translation from the polypeptide chains into the triple helices procollagen I though alpha 1(I) mRNA transcription was significantly increased and alpha 2(I) mRNA transcription was in normal range. Fibroblasts might release high quantities of free alpha 1(I) polypeptide chains or (alpha 1(I)) 3 homotrimer into the extracellular space during the fibrosing stage of frozen shoulder and Dupuytren disease. - In all samples neither differences of alpha 1(III) mRNA transcription nor differences of immunohistochemical staining intensity of collagen III could be seen. This might result from apoptosis of myofibroblasts in the final phase of the fibrosing processes. - The stimulating effect of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) to induce fibrosis in connective tissue such as scarlet is known. In all patients suffering from frozen shoulder and Dupuytren disease the serum IGF-I level was in a normal range and the IGF-I receptor - (IGFR-I) mRNA transcription in the samples was also in the same level compared with normal capsule tissue.",European journal of medical research,18024269,2007
The expression of myoglobin and ROR2 protein in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a hand disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance, especially among populations of northern European ancestry. The etiology and pathophysiology of DD are not clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the gene expression profiles of palmar fascia of DD and healthy patients using microarray analysis to highlight the genes that might contribute to the pathogenesis of DD.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dupuytren contracture samples were taken from excised mature cords of DD patients during aponeurectomies. Control samples were collected from healthy hand trauma patients. Microarray analysis was performed with the Affymetrix HGU133A genome array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Expression changes of selected proteins were confirmed at the protein level with Western and dot blotting or by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: At least an 8-fold change in gene expression was found with 127 genes, including a 90-fold down-regulation of myoglobin and a 14-fold up-regulation of tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (= ROR2) from absent to present during the disease. The changes in myoglobin and ROR2 expression were confirmed at the protein level.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed for the first time the connection of ROR2 in Dupuytren's disease. ROR2 and myoglobin may play an important role in the pathophysiology of this disease.",The Journal of surgical research,17996904,2007
Results of surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease in women: a review of 109 consecutive patients.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease is not as commonly reported in women as in men.

The purpose of this study was to further examine the presentation and surgical outcome of Dupuytren's disease in women, including complications and to compare these outcomes to a similar cohort of men and to previous studies of Dupuytren's disease in women.METHODS: A retrospective case series review was undertaken, and we identified all women who were admitted for surgical correction of Dupuytren's disease since 1990. Comparison was made with men operated during the same period. Pre- and postoperative measurements for lack of extension at the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint were made by the senior author. SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Il) was used for statistical analysis. The t test was used to compare the two groups.RESULTS: One hundred nine women were identified, with 119 operated hands, out of a total of 657 patients operated. Comparisons were made with 548 men. The average age at presentation was 63 years in women, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. One hundred five of the patients had digital involvement. The little and ring fingers were involved most frequently. Thirty-four had involvement of the MCPJ. Mean preoperative contracture was 35 degrees . Mean postoperative contracture was 1 degrees . Proximal interphalangeal joint involvement was seen in 66 patients. Mean preoperative contracture was 42 degrees . Mean postoperative contracture was 7 degrees . Distal joint involvement was identified in only 4 digits. There was no statistical difference with the men as regards digital involvement and joint involvement; however, correction at the PIP joint was significantly lower. Fasciectomy was performed in 107 cases (90%), fasciectomy and local flap in 7 cases (6%), and dermafasciectomy in 5 cases (4%). The most common complication was digital nerve/artery injury (6 patients), and disease recurrence rate was 22%. These were statistically similar to the men.CONCLUSIONS: Dupuytren's disease is less prevalent in women but its symptomatic presentation is similar to that in men, with more severe involvement of the PIP joint and a similar recurrence rate. The surgical outcomes, however, were equivalent with regard to final contracture correction, recurrence, and complication rates.",The Journal of hand surgery,17996779,2007
Dupuytren's disease following acute injury in Japanese patients: Dupuytren's disease or not?,"This paper reports the development of Dupuytren's disease following acute injury in 16 hands in 14 Japanese patients. The patients included six women and eight men. Five patients developed disease following trauma, one following infection and eight following elective surgery. In the present series, the patient age and sex are irrelevant. The disease was unilateral, confined to a single digital ray, and without ectopic lesions in most cases. Disease presented predominantly in the ring or middle finger rays. There were only three patients who underwent surgery for definite flexion contracture. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequently associated risk factor. Our results suggest that Dupuytren's disease following acute injury could be considered a separate entity from typical Dupuytren's disease. At present, we believe that this condition should be considered a subtype of Dupuytren's disease.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17950225,2007
Dupuytren's disease in Oriental Jews.,"Twelve month minimum follow-up was available for 19 Oriental Jewish patients who underwent surgery for Dupuytren's disease over a 10-year period. In this population, the disease is uncommon. The initial deformity, operative findings and results of surgery were similar to those described for North European Caucasian patients. Possible factors that may result in a low genetic predisposition to Dupuytren's disease amongst Jews are discussed.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17950218,2007
"An assessment of the effects of exposure to vibration, smoking, alcohol and diabetes on the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease in 97,537 miners.","A consecutive sample of 97,537 miners seeking compensation for Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome were examined in a medical assessment process which included documentation of age, hand dominance, Dupuytren's disease, years of vibration exposure, history of diabetes, smoking habits and units of alcohol consumption per week. The prime determinant of prevalence of Dupuytren's disease was age, and all other factors investigated were corrected for age. There was no statistically significant correlation between years of exposure to vibration and the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease. There was a statistically significant association with smoking, alcohol consumption and diabetes mellitus, with the heaviest smokers having an odds ratio (OR) of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.17, 1.47), the heaviest drinkers (in excess of 22 units a week) having an OR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.47, 1.72) and diabetes mellitus patients having an increase in the odds of having Dupuytren's disease of 1.52 (95% CI 1.30, 1.77).","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17950195,2007
Postoperative hand therapy in Dupuytren's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative hand therapy in patients after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture is common medical practice to improve outcomes. Until now, patients are referred for postoperative hand rehabilitation on an empirical basis.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether referral criteria after surgery because of Dupuytren's disease were actually adhered to, and, to analyse differences in outcomes between patients who were referred according to the criteria (correctly referred) and those who were not referred but should have been (incorrectly not referred).METHODS: Referral pattern was evaluated prospectively in 46 patients. Total active/passive range of joint motion (TAM/ TPM), sensibility, pinch force, Disability Arm Shoulder Hand questionnaire (DASH) and Michigan Hand outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) were used as outcome measures preoperatively and 10 months postoperatively.RESULTS: In total 21 patients were referred correctly and 17 patients were incorrectly not referred. Significant improvements on TAM/TPM, DASH and MHQ were found at follow-up for the total group. No differences in outcomes were found between patients correctly referred and patients incorrectly not referred for postoperative hand therapy.CONCLUSION: Referral criteria were not adhered to. Given the lack of differences in outcomes between patients correctly referred and patients incorrectly not referred, postoperative hand therapy in Dupuytren's disease should be reconsidered.",Disability and rehabilitation,17852228,2007
"[Role of fibroblasts in physiologic, reparative and pathologic processes].","Fibroblast is counted as one of the important cell of the connective tissue. At the present time many phenotypes are known taking part in normal, repair and pathological processes, meanwhile cellular and molecular events occur, where fibroblasts play essential role.

Dupuytren's disease: diagnosis and treatment.,"Dupuytren's disease is a progressive condition that causes the fibrous tissue of the palmar fascia to shorten and thicken. The disease is common in men older than 40 years; in persons of Northern European descent; and in persons who smoke, use alcohol, or have diabetes. Patients present with a small, pitted nodule (or multiple nodules) on the palm, which slowly progresses to contracture of the fingers. The disease initially can be managed with observation and nonsurgical therapy. It will regress without treatment in approximately 10 percent of patients. Steroid injection into the nodule has been shown to reduce the need for surgery. Surgical referral should be made when metacarpophalangeal joint contracture reaches 30 degrees or when proximal interphalangeal joint contracture occurs at any degree. Timing of surgical intervention varies, but surgery is usually performed when the metacarpophalangeal joint contracture exceeds 40 degrees or when the proximal interphalangeal joint contracture exceeds 20 degrees. In-office percutaneous needle aponeurotomy is an alternative to surgery.",American family physician,17668844,2007
50 years experience with Dupuytren's contracture in the Erlangen University Hospital--a retrospective analysis of 2919 operated hands from 1956 to 2006.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a hand disorder mainly among the northern population. In contrast it is rare in the mediterranean population. Therefore typical habits and dietetic influences have been discussed as well as genetic predisposition. Still, since the first description by Dupuytren in 1834 only little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease. Some hints were found for a higher prevalence among people with diabetes, alcohol abuse or smoking. Also, intensive manual work or hand injuries have been discussed to have an influence on DD. To our knowledge this is the largest retrospectively evaluated series of symptomatic patients published to date. The study includes patients from the last 50 years. It was performed to show possible correlations between DD and typical risk factors such as diabetes, alcohol consumption, and smoking.METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all patient records with DD documented between 1956 and 2006 in the Surgical University Hospital in Erlangen. Data acquisition was conducted by reviewing the medical records from 1956 to 2006 including data from all patients who were surgically treated because of DD.RESULTS: We reviewed 2579 male and 340 female surgically treated patients with DD. More than 80% of the patients were between 40 and 70 years old. In 28.9% only the right hand was effected by DD, in 25.3% only the left hand and in 45.8% both hands. In 10.3% of all Patients suffered from Diabetes mellitus. Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between diabetes, alcoholism or smoking on the degree of DD in our patients.CONCLUSION: Most data are consistent with previously published results from smaller, comparable retrospective studies with regard to right- or left handedness. We could not confirm a statistically significant correlation of DD with diabetes mellitus, severe alcohol consumption, heavy smoking or epilepsy and the stage of the disease as described in other studies. However, in the whole cohort of our operated patients during the last 50 years the prevalence of the above mentioned risk factors is slightly higher than in the normal population.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,17610744,2007
Efficacy and safety of injectable mixed collagenase subtypes in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.,"PURPOSE: To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of an injectable mixed subtype collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture (DC).METHODS: Patients with flexion deformities of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 20 degrees or greater were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients completing this phase could enter an open-label extension phase. The primary efficacy variable was clinical success: contracture correction to within 5 degrees of normal (normal, 0 degrees ). Additional efficacy variables included the time and number of injections required to achieve success in the primary joint. Recurrence of contracture to 20 degrees or greater in successfully treated joints and adverse events (AEs) were recorded.RESULTS: Thirty-three of 35 patients (mean +/- SD, 61 +/- 9 y) entering the double-blind phase completed the study; 19 of them entered the open-label extension. In the double-blind phase, clinical success of the primary joint was achieved in 16 of 23 patients receiving 1 injection and in 21 of 23 patients receiving 3 injections. No placebo-treated patients achieved joint correction. In the open-label extension, 17 of 19 patients achieved clinical success in at least 1 joint. The mean number of injections for clinical success in the double-blind and extension phases was 1.5 and 1.4, respectively; the time to clinical success ranged between 1 and 29 days. Overall, of 62 joints (31 MCP, 31 PIP) treated in 35 patients, 54 joints achieved clinical success. Over the 24-month follow-up period after the last injection, 5 joints had a recurrence. The most frequent treatment-related AEs were local reactions to injections. AEs were mild and resolved over several weeks. There were no serious treatment-related AEs.CONCLUSIONS: The collagenase injections safely and effectively corrected MCP and PIP contractures in patients with 1 or more DC-affected joints. Recurrence rates after treatment appear to be low. Data suggest that this collagenase appears to be a viable nonsurgical treatment option for DC.",The Journal of hand surgery,17606053,2007
[Dupuytren's disease. State of the art and therapeutic perspectives].,"Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibroproliferative disorder characterised by the sclerosis and the retractile thickening of the medial palmar aponeurosis and digital aponeurosis, which can lead to the progressive and irreversible finger flexion. Genetic, metabolic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease, but their role is not clearly established. Different medical therapies have been proposed for Dupuytren's disease treatment, but their real effectiveness has not been shown. Surgical therapy (fasciectomy) is the most used treatment, whose purpose is to correct finger deformity and to avoid joint ankylosis. A team of French rheumatologists has developed a non-surgical approach, the percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF), whose results in less aggressive forms of Dupuytren's disease are comparable to traditional surgery. PNF can be rapidly performed, presents a low cost and a low rate of complications and represents a valid alternative to surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease. In this review we report our results on 24 patients treated with PNA for Dupuytren's contracture.",Reumatismo,17603691,2007
Evaluation of treatment results of patients with Dupuytren's contracture--our clinical experience.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a common condition leading to impairment of the function of the hand which affects from 2 to 12 % of the population, mainly males, and presents as progressive contracture of fingers caused by shortening of the palmar aponeurosis. The objective of the work was to present our own approach to managing Dupuytren's disease and evaluate treatment results in patients with hypertrophy of the palmar aponeurosis. Material and method 288 patients with Dupuytren's disease were treated at the Plastic Surgery Hospital in Polanica Zdroj over a period of 25 years (1977-2002). The present paper is a retrospective analysis of treatment results in 253 patients for whom complete medical documentation was available. All patients were operated in local anaesthesia in ischemia. A Bunnell flap skin incision was followed by a fasciectomy of the hypertrophied segment of the palmar aponeurosis. The skin wound was closed using V-Y plasty. Postoperative management involved hand elevation and early rehabilitation. Results Restoration of the full range of motion and total extension in the MP joint and the interphalangeal joints were achieved in 70% and 68% of patients, respectively. Of 145 patients who were professionally active, 132 were able to return to work. Finger amputation was necessary in 2 patients, one patient suffered from arthrodesis and two other developed skin necrosis which was removed with the wound closed by skin grafts. A follow-up examination 6 months after the operation revealed a recurrence in 8 patients and deterioration of hand dexterity with finger stiffness in 4. Conclusions A low complication rate and good treatment results are arguments in favour of the approach adopted at our hospital, i.e. surgery in local anaesthesia in ischemia with compressive bandaging, using a Bunnell flap skin incision followed by radical fasciectomy and V-Y plasty.","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",17538519,2007

A complete expression profile of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases in Dupuytren's disease.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibrotic condition of the palmar fascia, leading to deposition of collagen-rich cords and finger contractions. The metzincin superfamily contains key enzymes in the turnover of collagen and other extracellular matrix macromolecules. A number of broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, used in cancer clinical trials, caused side effects of DD-like contractures. We tested the hypothesis that changes in the expression of specific metalloproteinases underlie or contribute to the fibrosis and contracture seen in DD.METHODS: We collected tissue from patients with DD and used normal palmar fascia as a control. We profiled the expression of the entire matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) gene families in these tissues using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: A number of metalloproteinases and inhibitors are regulated in DD. The expression of 3 key collagenases, MMP1, MMP13, and MMP14 is increased significantly in the DD nodule, as is the expression of the collagen biosynthetic enzyme ADAMTS14. The expression of MMP7, an enzyme with broad substrate specificity, is increased in the DD nodule and remains equally expressed in the DD cord. TIMP1 expression is increased significantly in DD nodule compared with normal palmar fascia.CONCLUSIONS: This study measured the expression of all MMP, ADAMTS, and TIMP genes in DD. Contraction and fibrosis may result from: (1) increased collagen biosynthesis mediated by increased ADAMTS-14; (2) an increased level of TIMP-1 blocking MMP-1- and MMP-13-mediated collagenolysis; and (3) contraction enabled by MMP-14-mediated pericellular collagenolysis (and potentially MMP-7), which may escape inhibition by TIMP-1. The complete expression profile will provide a knowledge-based approach to novel therapeutics targeting these genes.",The Journal of hand surgery,17336841,2007
Immunohistochemical evidence of nerve growth factor in Dupuytren's diseased palmar fascia.,"PURPOSE: Histologically, the pathognomic feature of Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is the myofibroblast. Its occurrence in this disease has been associated with local production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-B. However, nerve growth factor (NGF) is a recognized growth factor involved in wound healing and has been shown to induce the myofibroblast phenotype in cultured fibroblasts. We hypothesized that NGF would be abundant in this disease entity.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine for the presence of NGF in 25 surgical specimens from patients with DC and in surgical specimens from 5 other, unrelated procedures. Patient demographics showed that nearly all patients were men, with a mean age of 61 years (range 36-77). Serial sections were probed with antibodies, stained, and then digitally photomicrographed. Disease staging was also performed. Image analysis was then used to measure the percentage of area stained. In addition, representative sections were probed for TrkA, the high-affinity receptor for NGF, and alpha-smooth muscle actin, a cytoskeletal marker of the myofibroblast phenotype. These alternate steps were used to infer functional dependence and the association of NGF with myofibroblast populations.RESULTS: Histologically, all patients had either stage II or III disease. Biopsy results showed an abundance of NGF--over double that of controls. The highest levels of NGF occurred in hypercellular stage II disease. In addition, we confirmed that NGF is linked to the expression of both TrkA receptors and alpha-smooth muscle actin.CONCLUSIONS: Tissue levels of NGF are elevated in Dupuytren's disease. This tissue is competent to respond to NGF and manifests an abundance of myofibroblasts in areas of NGF expression. Nerve growth factor is most apparent in the proliferative (hyperplastic) stage of the disease. These data infer that NGF is linked to the pathologic process.",The Journal of hand surgery,17336840,2007
The effect of the severity of the Dupuytren's contracture on the function of the hand before and after surgery.,"This study investigated the effect on the power and function of the hand of loss of finger(s) extension, number of fingers involved and the patient's age in Dupuytren's disease and the influence of improvement of finger extension and the patient's age on these variables after surgery. Median values at presentation included total loss of extension 80 degrees, total grip strength 41 kg and DASH score 54. Twelve months postoperatively, the median value of total loss of extension decreased to 10 degrees and the DASH score to 32 (both significant improvements). Grip strength decreased slightly to 40 kg. The severity of the contracture had no significant effect on function but had a significant negative effect on power. The number of fingers involved affected neither function nor power. The age of the patient did not influence function of the hand. However, older patients experienced less functional benefit from surgery. The improvement of finger extension following surgery had significant beneficial effect on function, but no effect on power.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17335947,2007
Clinical results of dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease in Japanese patients.,"The surgical outcomes of dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease were evaluated in nine hands of eight patients in a Japanese population. The patients were examined for postoperative complications, problems associated with the skin graft, evidence of recurrent disease, sensation over the graft and pre- and postoperative range of motion at the metacarpophalangeal and the proximal interphalangeal joints. The mean two-point discrimination over the skin graft was 14 mm. The mean remaining flexion contracture at the metacarpophalangeal joint was 5 degrees and that at the proximal interphalangeal joint was 34 degrees . Recurrence occurred in two patients: one had a minor nodule and the other a natatory cord, which did not result in the redevelopment of a contracture. This study supports the use of dermofasciectomy for the treatment of recurrent Dupuytren's disease, as well as for the treatment of primary disease in those patients with a strong Dupuytren's diathesis in this population.","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",17287058,2007
Predicting the outcome of surgery for the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease.,"PURPOSE: We prospectively studied the outcome of limited Dupuytren's fasciectomy, in combination with joint release if necessary, for disease involving 49 proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJs) to identify factors that predispose to recurrent PIPJ contracture.METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were treated over a 4-year period. The flexion contracture of the PIPJ was measured before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at more than 1 year after surgery.RESULTS: A mean preoperative flexion contracture of 67 degrees +/- 22 degrees was corrected to 6 degrees +/- 10 degrees at the time of surgery and 25 degrees +/- 25 degrees at the follow-up evaluation. There was a positive correlation between the severity of the preoperative flexion contracture and recurrent deformity, with a preoperative contracture greater than 60 degrees leading to significantly worse outcome. Incomplete correction of PIPJ flexion contracture during surgery and poor postoperative compliance with therapy were also associated with worse recurrent joint contractures. The digit involved and the necessity for joint release did not significantly affect outcome.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of recurrent Dupuytren's disease, severe preoperative deformity, incomplete correction at surgery, and noncompliance with therapy predispose patients to worse PIPJ contracture.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic II.",The Journal of hand surgery,17275601,2007
Fasciectomy and conservative full thickness skin grafting in Dupuytren's contracture. The fish technique.,"We reviewed 79 patients with a total of 100 digits affected by Dupuytren's disease, who were treated surgically in our institution between 1990 and 1998. The mean follow-up was 4.4 years with a range of 2 to 10 years. Only patients with PIP joint deformity of more than 30 degrees were included in the study. All patients had radical excision of diseased fascia tissue to the mid axial line and application of a full thickness skin graft over the proximal phalanx without any skin excision. Twenty two rays had two-stage operations involving percutaneous fasciotomy and application of S-Quattro followed by the definitive procedure after an interval of 6-8 weeks. Patients were clinically assessed for recurrence, extension of disease, 2-point discrimination, finger sensation, graft or donor site problem and patient satisfaction. Seven fingers had recurrent disease, none of which crossed the graft. The present study shows that radical excision of Dupuytren's tissue with full thickness graft without excision of involved skin as a primary procedure reduces recurrence. These results are comparable to those for dermofasciectomy, as reported in previous series.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,17260604,2007
Dupuytren's disease: outcome of the proximal interphalangeal joint in isolated fifth ray involvement.,"In this study of 38 patients, we assessed the clinical result following surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease with isolated fifth ray involvement, particularly with respect to the proximal interphalangeal joint. Three surgical techniques were used: limited fasciectomy, segmental fasciectomy and dermofasciectomy. At a mean follow-up time of 53.6 months, there were no residual deformities nor recurrences in the metacarpophalangeal joint. At the proximal interphalangeal joint, there was an overall improvement of 45 degrees in movement with a residual flexion deformity avering 30 degrees. The recurrence rate in this series was 39%. There was no significant difference in residual deformity or recurrence rate between the various surgical techniques used. Fifth ray involvement in Dupuytren's disease remains a surgical challenge, especially at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Residual deformity and recurrence rate remain high, irrespective of the surgical technique used.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,17260603,2007
Gelatinase A activity in Dupuytren's disease.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder of the hand characterized by an abnormal myofibroblast and fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition leading to retraction and deformation of the palm. Recent studies have shown that molecules of extracellular matrix may coordinate morphogenesis, cell differentiation, and most importantly, fibrogenesis in tissue. Gelatinase A (MMP-2) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family of proteolytic enzymes that contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix by degrading its components. The aim of this study was to determine the level of MMP-2 activation in the palmar fascia of patients with Dupuytren's contracture with reference to the clinical stages of disease progression and recurrence of the contracture after surgery.METHODS: The level of relative MMP-2 activation, expressed by the active to latent MMP-2 ratio, was investigated with use of zymography and computerized densitometry in 16 normal and 71 pathologic tissues characterizing different clinical stages of the disease progression.RESULTS: We found that the level of MMP-2 activation was significantly elevated in the palmar fascias with Dupuytren's contracture compared with normal tissues. We did not find statistically significant differences between groups with different stages of the disease progression. We also did not find a relation between a high level of MMP-2 activation and the recurrence in the area of surgically treated Dupuytren's contracture.CONCLUSIONS: The differences in MMP-2 activation between contractured and normal fascia suggest a participation of this enzyme in the promotion of Dupuytren's disease. We did not find a relationship, however, between the level of MMP-2 activation and the secondary contracture.",The Journal of hand surgery,17145384,2006
Dupuytren's diathesis revisited: Evaluation of prognostic indicators for risk of disease recurrence.,"PURPOSE: The term diathesis relates to certain features of Dupuytren's disease (DD) and dictates an aggressive course of disease. The initial description of DD diathesis included 4 factors: (1) ethnicity, (2) family history, (3) bilateral DD, and (4) ectopic lesions (DD outside the palm). The degree of diathesis is considered important in predicting recurrence and extension of DD after surgical management. Prognostic indicators of risks associated with surgery are important. We aimed to evaluate these 4 factors and known associated risk factors to formulate a statistical predictive value for DD diathesis.METHODS: Caucasian patients diagnosed with DD between the ages of 25 and 90 years (n = 322) from Northwest England were assessed for DD diathesis with a clinical history and examination. DD diathesis assessment was analyzed by calculating the odds ratios of developing recurrent DD using logistic regression.RESULTS: The observed recurrence rates in the presence of notable risk factors and corresponding odds ratios of recurrent DD were calculated. Of note, recurrent disease was observed in 121 (46%) males, 105 (47%) with bilateral DD, 68 (48%) with a family history of DD, 75 (47%) with age at onset younger than 50 years, 35 (52%) in those with ectopic lesions, and in 26 (63%) with Garrod's pads.CONCLUSIONS: The original DD diathesis factors have been evaluated and modified. The original factors of family history, bilateral DD, and ectopic lesions now include 2 additional factors: male gender and age at onset of younger than 50 years. Family history and ectopic disease have now been modified to specify family history with one or more affected siblings/parents and ectopic lesions in the knuckles (Garrod's pads) alone. The presence of all new DD diathesis factors in a patient increases the risk of recurrent DD by 71% compared with a baseline risk of 23% in those DD patients with none of the earlier-described factors.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic II.",The Journal of hand surgery,17145383,2006
The effects of the diabetes related soft tissue hand lesions and the reduced hand strength on functional disability of hand in type 2 diabetic patients.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of diabetes related soft tissue hand lesions such as Dupuytren's disease, trigger finger and limited joint mobility (LJM) and the reduced hand strength on the functional disability of the hand in type 2 diabetic patients.METHODS: Forty-four type 2 diabetic patients and 60 age and sex matched controls were included in the study. Subjects were examined for the presence of Dupuytren's disease, trigger finger and LJM. Grip strength was tested first with Jamar dynamometer followed by pinch strength measurements using by a manual pinchmeter. Electrophysiological studies were performed in both groups. Duruöz Hand Index (DHI) was used to assess the functional hand disability.RESULTS: The mean DHI score of the diabetics was significantly higher than controls (p&lt;0.0001). Dupuytren's disease, trigger finger or LJM was not correlated with DHI in diabetic patients (p&gt;0.05). The grip and pinch strengths were significantly lower in diabetic patients than the non-diabetic controls (p&lt;0.05) and the grip and pinch strengths were negatively correlated with DHI in type 2 diabetic patients (p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: Dupuytren's disease, trigger finger and LJM did not cause to functional disability of hand but low hand strength was found to cause functional disability of hand in our type 2 diabetic patients.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,17141353,2006
Beta-catenin signaling in fibroproliferative disease.,"BACKGROUND: Beta-catenin has been historically recognized as both an intermediate in the &quot;canonical Wnt signaling pathway&quot; and as a component of functional adherens junctions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cellular accumulation of beta-catenin levels can result in transactivation of gene transcription and cellular proliferation during normal cellular and disease development. Recent evidence has identified beta-catenin in an additional role as a component of cutaneous wound healing.RESULTS: This finding is in keeping with previous observations that post-translational modifications of beta-catenin that are associated with its cytoplasmic accumulation are frequently observed in fibroproliferative diseases with characteristics of dysregulated wound healing. These diseases include hypertrophic scar formation, aggressive fibromatoses, Lederhose disease, and Dupuytren's contracture (DC).CONCLUSIONS: While its precise roles in disease initiation and progression remain to be explored, this review highlights our current knowledge of beta-catenin regulation and describes some potential upstream mediators of beta-catenin accumulation and signaling in fibroproliferative disease.",The Journal of surgical research,17109886,2006
Factors in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture.,This article reviews the basic science elements involved in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. Dupuytren's contracture is effected by a multitude of complex processes at the cellular level and the exact relative contribution of each is unknown. Various investigators have proposed different theories and documented individual findings regarding the pathophysiology of Dupuytren's contracture. The current report attempts to summarize many of these findings together in a schema of pathogenesis.,The Journal of hand surgery,17095386,2006
[Lateral sagittal infraclavicular block: a case report of three patients].,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis performed on healthy volunteers assessed the effectiveness of brachial plexus block via the lateral sagittal infraclavicular approach to be easy-performed and relatively safe. In this case report, we presented three cases to whom we performed infraclavicular block via the lateral sagittal approach. One of our cases was a high risk patient with osteomyelitis of the elbow joint and the other was a patient who had required surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. The third one was a patient admitted to emergency room who had got open metacarps fractures. Lateral sagittal infraclavicular block was planned in all of the patients. Twenty minutes after local anesthetic (LA) injection, sufficient surgical anesthesia was achieved. Non of the patients developed vascular puncture, LA toxicity and pneumothorax. In conclusion, LSIB appears to be an easy, a safe and a more acceptable approach for the patient, therefore a good alternative.",Agri : Agri (Algoloji) Dernegi'nin Yayin organidir = The journal of the Turkish Society of Algology,17089232,2006
Ulnar-based skin flap for Dupuytren's fasciectomy.,"The mainstay of treatment for symptomatic Dupuytren's disease is operation. Various skin incisions have been described, showing that there is no single best incision. We describe an ulnar-based skin flap for excision of palmar disease. This flap allows excellent exposure of the diseased area, and provides good access to the palmar aponeurosis including the difficult area on the ulnar side of the little finger. Healing is reliable and digital disease can be approached with a skin extension as required. Recurrent disease can be treated by raising the same flap again.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,17065122,2006
[Dupuytren's contracture].,"For an uncomplicated Dupuytren's contracture (no pain or paresthesias), the currently accepted optimal treatment option is surgery in stage II-III. The fewer the secondary alterations to tendons, skin and joints, the better are the functional results that may be expected. Further factors impacting on the surgical outcome are the choice of incision and the occurrence of early complications (hematomas, graft necrosis, wound healing disorders, infections).",MMW Fortschritte der Medizin,17059195,2006
Identification of protein biomarkers in Dupuytren's contracture using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).,"BACKGROUND: To study the protein expression profiles associated with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) to identify potential disease protein biomarkers (PBM) using a proteomic technology--Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).METHODS: Normal and disease palmar fascia from DC patients were analyzed using Ciphergen's SELDI-TOF-MS Protein Biological System II (PBSII) ProteinChip reader. Analysis of the resulting SELDI-TOF spectra was carried out using the peak cluster analysis program (BioMarker Wizard, Ciphergen). Common peak clusters were then filtered using a bootstrap algorithm called SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarrays) for increased fidelity in our analysis.RESULTS: Several differentially expressed low molecular weight (&lt;20 kDa) tissue proteins were identified. Spectra generated using both ZipTipC18 aided Au array and WCX2 array based SELDI-TOF-MS were reproducible, with an average peak cluster mass standard deviation for both methods of &lt;1.74 x10(-4). Initial peak cluster analysis of the SELDI spectra identified both up-(14) and down-(3)regulated proteins associated with DC. Further analysis of the peak cluster data using the bootstrap algorithm SAM identified three disease-associated protein features (4600.8 Da, 10254.5 Da, and 11405.1 Da) that were elevated (5.45, 11.7, and 4.28 fold, respectively, with a 0% median false discovery rate).CONCLUSION: SELDI-TOF-MS identified three potential low molecular weight tissue protein markers (p4.6DC, p1ODC, p11.7DC) for DC. The ability of SELDI-TOF-MS to resolve low molecular weight proteins suggests that the method may provide a means of deciphering the biomarker-rich low molecular weight region of the human proteome. Application of such novel technology may help clinicians to focus on specific molecular abnormalities in diseases with no known molecular pathogenesis, and uncover therapeutic and/or diagnostic targets.",Clinical and investigative medicine.

Two significant complications following percutaneous needle fasciotomy in a patient on anticoagulants.,"Percutaneous needle fasciotomy treatment of Dupuytren's disease has been used on the continent for over two decades but has only recently gained popularity in the UK. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence published guidance in February 2004 stating that the procedure is safe and effective. We report a case of two complications in the same patient following the use of the technique, on only one occasion, in a patient who was anticoagulated. We believe that it is the first time that a false aneurysm has been reported following the procedure and that this was probably related to the inhibited coagulation cascade. The patient also sustained an injury to flexor digitorum profundus but had an intact superficialis tendon and we find it difficult to explain this occurrence. We report the above complication as we feel this technique may be chosen specifically in patients with co-existing medical problems such as anticoagulation.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",17045371,2006
[Dupuytren's disease].,"Dupuytren's disease is a contracture of the hand derived from the retractile fibrosis of the palmar aponeurosis, that leads to a progressive deformity in flexion of fingers. It has been named from the French surgeon Guillaume Dupuytren (1777-1835), that described it in 1831.

Wnt expression is not correlated with beta-catenin dysregulation in Dupuytren's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture or disease (DD) is a fibro-proliferative disease of the hand that results in finger flexion contractures. Increased cellular beta-catenin levels have been identified as characteristic of this disease. As Wnts are the most widely recognized upstream regulators of cellular beta-catenin accumulation, we have examined Wnt gene expression in surgical specimens and in DD-derived primary cell cultures grown in two-dimensional monolayer culture or in three-dimensional FPCL collagen lattice cultures.RESULTS: The Wnt expression profile of patient-matched DD and unaffected control palmar fascia tissue was determined by a variety of complimentary methods; Affymetrix Microarray analysis, specific Wnt and degenerative primer-based Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and Real Time PCR. Microarray analysis identified 13 Wnts associated with DD and control tissues. Degenerate Wnt RT-PCR analysis identified Wnts 10b and 11, and to a lesser extent 5a and 9a, as the major Wnt family members expressed in our patient samples. Competitive RT-PCR analysis identified significant differences between the levels of expression of Wnts 9a, 10b and 11 in tissue samples and in primary cell cultures grown as monolayer or in FPCL, where the mRNA levels in tissue &gt; FPCL cultures &gt; monolayer cultures. Real Time PCR data confirmed the down-regulation of Wnt 11 mRNA in DD while Wnt 10b, the most frequently isolated Wnt in DD and control palmar fascia, displayed widely variable expression between the methods of analysis.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that changes in Wnt expression per se are unlikely to be the cause of the observed dysregulation of beta-catenin expression in DD.",Journal of negative results in biomedicine,16942611,2006
Feedback inhibition of high TGF-beta1 concentrations on myofibroblast induction and contraction by Dupuytren's fibroblasts.,"Myofibroblasts and TGF-beta1 are implicated in Dupuytren's contracture. Transforming growth fact- or beta1(TGF-beta1) (1-10ng/ml) increases myofibroblast induction in Dupuytren's fibroblasts and contraction in a collagen model. However, higher doses (20-30ng/ml) inhibit contraction in dermal fibroblasts. We hypothesized higher doses of TGF-beta1 would inhibit induction of myofibroblasts and contraction by Dupuytren's fibroblasts. Increasing doses of TGF-beta1 (0-30ng/ml) were tested on Dupuytren's fibroblasts using immunofluorescence to determine myofibroblast upregulation and a 3D collagen model used to determine contractile forces. Flexor retinaculum fibroblasts were used as controls. TGF-beta1 induced myofibroblasts in Dupuytren's fibroblasts (n=3) from 12% (0ng/ml) to 23% (12.5ng/ml) at 24 hours but dropped to 13% at 30ng/ml (P&lt;0.05). This response was mirrored in the contraction profiles. These trends were similar for flexor retinaculum fibroblasts (n=3), but contractile forces and myofibroblast induction were significantly less (P&lt;0.001). This is the first report of negative feedback inhibition of TGF-beta1 at higher concentrations in Dupuytren's fibroblasts.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16875762,2006
[An assessment of the influence of the severity of Dupuytren's contracture on the dexterity of the hand before and after surgery].,"It seems to evident that deformation of the hand as a result of Dupuytren's contracture should cause weakness and overall functional impairment of the hand, and an increase of range of motion of the fingers as a result of the operation should effect in improvement of these parameters. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of extension loss of fingers, number of fingers involved and age of the patients on the power and dexterity of the hand, as well as influence of the age of the patients and recovery of extension of the fingers on the power and dexterity of the hand after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. 54 patients in an age range 32-83 years (mean 60) with the disease lasting av. 5 years underwent subtotal fasciectomy. Total extension loss of the fingers and total grip strength were measured and dexterity of the hand was assessed with DASH questionnaire prior to surgery. Patients were followed-up for 1 year and assessments were repeated at 1, 3 and finally at 12 months. Median values of measured variables at presentation were as follows: extension loss 80 degrees, total grip strength 41 kG, and DASH score 54. At 12 months median extension loss decreased to 10 degrees (stat. sign.), DASH score to 32 (stat. sign. improvement of dexterity) and grip strength decreased slightly to 40 kG. An analysis of the relationship between the variables showed that severity of the contracture (expressed as an extension loss) had no effect on dexterity of the hand but had significant influence on deterioration of the total grip strength. Number of fingers involved did affect neither dexterity nor power of the hand. Age of the patients did not influence subjective feeling of dexterity of the hand, however, older patients experienced lesser functional benefit from the operation, than younger patients. An increase of extension of the fingers following surgery had significant beneficial effect on subjective improvement of the dexterity of the hand, but had not effect on the increase of power of the hand.",Chirurgia narzadow ruchu i ortopedia polska,16875185,2006

Dupuytren's contracture: an audit of the outcomes of surgery.,"This multi-centre postal questionnaire study was conducted by the Audit Committee of the BSSH to assess the outcomes of surgery for Dupuytren's Contracture using subjective data provided by 1177 patients at a mean follow-up of 27 (SD 8) months after surgery. Surgery for Dupuytren's contracture achieved a high rate of full, or almost full, correction in 826 patients (75%) but had a high incidence of post-operative patient-reported complications of 46%. A higher complication rate was seen in those patients with worse initial deformities. The rate of contracture recurrence or persistence was 158 of 1037 (15%). The severity of contracture correlated with the final hand function measured using the PEM score. Recurrence was more common in patients with greater initial deformity. Recurrence was less common if good correction was achieved at surgery. The relevance and limitations of this data are discussed.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16837113,2006
Results of partial fasciectomy for Dupuytren disease in 261 consecutive patients.,"Many different surgical techniques are still being used for Dupuytren disease. The outcome of 558 consecutive operations with 1 technique was reviewed. Distinct subgroups were made to detect risk factors for a poor outcome and complications. The mean follow-up time was 7.3 years. Younger patients (first surgery before 45 years) were operated significantly more than older patients (after 45 years). Results of contracted proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints were significantly worse than other joints. The overall complication rate was 26%. Nerve lesions occurred in 7.7%. Young age proved to be a prognostic factor for the total number of operations. The contracted PIP joints will lead to more complications and poorer result. The risk at nerve lesion, necrosis, and infection are higher for recurrent surgery. These findings can be used in advising patients.",Annals of plastic surgery,16799301,2006
[Clonality study of palmar fibromatosis].,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clonality of palmar fibromatosis by molecular genetic analysis of X chromosome inactivation pattern at a polymorphic site of human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA).METHODS: Twelve female cases of palmar fibromatosis were enrolled into this study. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues were microdissected by laser capture microdissection technology in order to obtain the proliferative spindle cells. Tumor cells isolated from rectal adenocarcinoma in a female patient were used as positive control. The genomic DNAs were extracted with phenol and chloroform, digested with methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers targeted to a highly polymorphic short tandem repeat of HUMARA. The amplimers were separated on vertical 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and the patterns were visualized with ethidium bromide stain.RESULTS: The methodology for clonality analysis was validated in the positive control using rectal adenocarcinoma cells. Among the 12 cases studied, PCR amplification failed in 3 samples and 1 sample showed homozygosity which was not suitable for further analysis. Eight samples were successfully amplified and showed a random X chromosome inactivation pattern, suggesting polyclonality in these lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Palmar fibromatosis is a polyclonal condition and should be considered as a form of non-neoplasmic fibroblastic proliferation.",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,16776980,2006
Percutaneous needle fasciotomy in dupuytren's disease.,"The aim of this study was to examine our results of 74 percutaneous needle fasciotomies for Dupuytren's contracture. Pre-operative and postoperative total passive extension deficit was measured. Patients were seen at the outpatient clinic at 32 months for final follow-up. Extension deficit and sensibility were measured and flexor tendon function assessed. Recurrence, defined as an increase of the passive extension deficit of 30 degrees or more compared to the immediate postoperative measurement, and other complications were also noted. Immediate outcome was excellent with an average improvement of 77%. After 32 months, we reviewed 55 rays. Their recurrence rate was 65%. Two patients experienced a slightly diminished sensibility on one side of the finger. There were no flexor tendon injuries. This procedure has a good short-term effect. It may be suitable for patients who want a minimally invasive treatment and to whom long-term results are less important. It may also have a place in delaying fasciectomy.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16766101,2006
A comparison of the direct outcomes of percutaneous needle fasciotomy and limited fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease: a 6-week follow-up study.,"PURPOSE: The demand for percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) as treatment for Dupuytren's disease is increasing because of its limited invasiveness, good outcome, limited number of complications, quick recovery, and overall patient satisfaction. This randomized controlled trial was designed to test whether these short-term expectations are sound by comparing this treatment with limited fasciectomy (LF) with regard to these aspects.METHODS: We treated 166 rays: 88 by PNF and 78 by LF. Total passive extension deficit (TPED) improvement at 1 week and at 6 weeks were the primary outcome parameters; patient satisfaction, hand-function recovery, and complication rate were secondary outcome parameters. We used the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire to measure disabilities of the upper extremity before and after treatment and all adverse effects and complications were recorded.RESULTS: Overall TPED improvement was best at 6 weeks. In the PNF group TPED improved by 63% versus 79% in the LF group; this difference was statistically significant. Results at the proximal interphalangeal joint were worse than those at the metacarpophalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints for both the PNF and LF groups. The rays classified before surgery as Tubiana stages I and II showed no difference between these treatments, but for rays higher than stage II LF clearly was superior to PNF as a treatment modality. The rate of major complications in the LF group was 5% versus 0% in the PNF group. Patient satisfaction was almost equal but direct hand function after treatment was considered better in the PNF group, as was the degree of discomfort that patients experienced. This was underscored by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores in the PNF group, which were significantly lower than those in the LF group at all time points measured.CONCLUSIONS: In the short term and in cases with a TPED of 90 degrees or less PNF is a good treatment alternative to LF for treatment of Dupuytren's disease.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, Level I.",The Journal of hand surgery,16713831,2006
[Comparative electronmicroscopic research on normal palmar aponeurosis and adulterated palmar aponeurosis in Dupuytren disease].,"This article represents a comparative research between the normal palmar aponeurosis seen with the electron microscope and adulterated palmar aponeurosis in Dupuytren disease. For that reason, we harvested normal palmar aponeurosis from 5 patients hospitalised in emergency in our department with different posttraumatic hand lesions, and adulterated palmar aponeurosis from 15 patients with Dupuytren disease. The samples were prepared to obtain sections visualised with the electron microscope. Comparative research of these sections lead to the conclusion that in the normal palmar aponeurosis the fibroblast is visualised in its resting functional form (fibrocytes), and in the adulterated palmar aponeurosis in Dupuytren disease the fibroblast is visualised in its active, secretory, form. In Dupuytren disease we found an increased, anarchic, collagen production, clinically demonstrated by nodules and fibrous strips. This paper is just a preliminary stage of a research looking for alternative, noninvasive, therapeutical methods in Dupuytren disease (ex. : effects of electromagnetic field made by millimeter waves on the adulterated palmar aponeurosis cell structure).",Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi,16610177,2006
Increased metabolic activity of fibroblasts derived from cords compared with nodule fibroblasts sampling from patients with Dupuytren's contracture.,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture is characterized by progress in several stages. The disease process includes two structurally distinct fibrotic elements, the so-called nodule and the cord. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the cause. Until now, there has been ongoing discussion regarding whether cords or nodules are the primary source of the disease.METHODS: Tissues from 24 patients with Dupuytren's disease were obtained during hand surgery, providing samples from nodules and cords for cell culture. Tissue from the flexor retinaculum excised from healthy patients during surgical procedures on the hand served as control. By using the explant culture technique, fibroblasts were isolated and grown in standard medium. Besides morphological analysis, XTT proliferation tests were performed at various time periods to measure the metabolic activity of the cultivated fibroblasts.RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed significant differences of nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts after 1 hour (p = 0.0150), 8 hours (p &lt; 0.0001), and 16 hours (p &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that distinct proliferative properties of Dupuytren-derived fibroblasts are dependent on the cells' origin. Conclusions about the cause or pathogenesis cannot yet be drawn. Further investigation concerning their apparently different fibroproliferative properties is necessary.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,16582795,2006
N-acetyl-L-cysteine abrogates fibrogenic properties of fibroblasts isolated from Dupuytren's disease by blunting TGF-beta signalling.,"Dupuytren's disease, a benign fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia, represents an ideal model to study tissue fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its downstream Smad signalling system is well established as a key player during fibrogenesis. Thus, targeting this basic pathomechanism seems suitable to establish new treatment strategies. One such promising treatment involves the substance N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), shown to have antifibrotic properties in hepatic stellate cells and rat fibroblasts. In order to investigate antifibrotic effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), fibroblasts were isolated from surgically resected fibrotic palmar tissues (Dupuytren fibroblasts, DF) and exposed to different concentrations of NAC and recombinant TGF-beta1. Fibroblasts isolated from tendon pulleys served as controls (control fibroblasts, CF). Smad signalling was investigated by a Smad binding element driven reporter gene analysis. Both cell types express TGF-beta1, indicating autocrine signalling in DF and CF. This was confirmed by comparing reporter gene activity from LacZ and Smad7 adenovirus infected cells. NAC treatment resulted in abrogation of Smad mediated signalling comparable to ectopically overexpressed Smad7, even when the cells were stimulated with recombinant TGF-beta1 or ectopically expressed a constitutively active TGF-beta receptor type I. Additionally, NAC dose-dependently decreased expression of three major indicators of impaired fibrotic matrix turnover, namely alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), alpha 1 type I procollagen (Col1A1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-type I (PAI-1). Our results suggest that TGF-beta signalling and subsequent expression of fibrogenesis related proteins in Dupuytren's disease is abrogated by NAC thus providing a basis for a therapeutic strategy in Dupuytren's disease and other fibroproliferative disorders.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,16563228,2006
"Expression of a novel gene, MafB, in Dupuytren's disease.","PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is characterized by fibroblastic proliferation of the palmar fascia, often leading to flexion contracture in the hand. Although there is a strong genetic component the genome-wide expression of novel genes is not known. The purpose of this study was to use DNA microarray technology to identify upregulated genes in DD.METHODS: Human tissue samples were harvested from 3 patient sources: DD cord tissue (n = 20), normal-appearing adjacent control fascia (n = 15), and palmar fascia from patients having carpal tunnel release (n = 15). DNA microarray analysis was performed on amplified sample RNA. Novel genes were compared with known gene functions. A candidate gene of interest was studied further by using immunohistochemistry on DD tissue samples and controls.RESULTS: Several novel genes not described previously in the study of DD were upregulated significantly, including MafB, collagen type V, alpha-2 (COL5A2), collagen type VIII, alpha-1 (COL8A1), contactin I (CNTN1), and leucine-rich repeat containing 17 (LRRC17). These upregulated genes were compared with their known gene-expression profiles in other tissues and their purported functions. MafB was found to be of particular interest because of its prominent role in tissue development and cellular differentiation. MafB immunohistochemistry showed positive staining in 50% of the DD specimens but complete absence of MafB in all control tissues (adjacent control fascia, carpal tunnel fascia). Co-localization experiments with MafB and alpha-smooth muscle actin showed staining properties in similar regions but these 2 proteins were not confined solely to the same cells.CONCLUSIONS: Microarray analysis of DD tissue has identified significant upregulated gene expression of MafB. MafB protein also is found in Dupuytren's cords but not in control fascia. Co-localization data suggest that the association of MafB with DD is not related exclusively to myofibroblast proliferation. Because of its role in fibroblastic transformation in other models MafB and its relationship to the pathogenesis of DD deserves further study.",The Journal of hand surgery,16473681,2006
The heritability of Dupuytren's disease: familial aggregation and its clinical significance.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign, fibroproliferative disease affecting the hands. The familial occurrence of DD and its presence in identical twins suggests a genetic basis for the condition. Our aims in this study were (1) to provide evidence for familial aggregation of DD by estimating the sibling recurrence-risk ratio and (2) to link previously associated environmental risk factors with family history of DD.METHODS: Patients diagnosed with DD between the ages of 58 and 81 years (N = 92) were interviewed to assess potential risks and the severity of their conditions. A clinical history and examination were performed and we attempted to interview every family member either in person or through a postal questionnaire.RESULTS: The sibling recurrence-risk ratio (lambda(s)) equaled 2.9 and ranged from 2.6 to 3.3 based on the 95% confidence intervals for the population prevalence. This suggests a high genetic basis for the causation of DD. A lower age of onset and greater severity of DD were associated significantly with a positive family history of DD. Other factors showed no statistical significance with familial aggregation of DD.CONCLUSIONS: The familial clustering observed in DD likely is due to genetic influence rather than shared environment, as shown by the lack of association with exposure to environmental risk factors and family history. Understanding the genetic basis of DD is important for developing novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic regimens in the future.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic, Level II.",The Journal of hand surgery,16473680,2006
Management of Dupuytren's disease--clear advice for an elusive condition.,"Dupuytren's disease is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder of an unknown origin affecting the hands causing permanent flexion contracture of the digits.

The disease also seems to deteriorate rapidly in those cases showing young age of onset and additional fibromatosis affecting the back of the hands, soles of the feet and the penis. Although there is no cure, patients with Dupuytren's disease of the hand may gain a significant functional benefit following surgical improvement or correction of the deformity.

The incidence of complex regional pain syndrome after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture: a prospective observational study of four anesthetic techniques.,"The development of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is not an uncommon complication after Dupuytren's surgery. Despite increasing research interest, little is known regarding which patients are at increased risk for developing CRPS and what is the optimal perioperative treatment strategy for preventing the occurrence of this disease after surgery. We prospectively evaluated the use of four anesthetic techniques (general anesthesia, axillary block, and IV regional anesthesia [IVRA] with lidocaine with or without clonidine) for patients undergoing fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture. All patients were followed in the Pain Management Center at 1, 3, and 12 mo postoperatively by a blinded physician to evaluate the presence of CRPS. Significantly (P &lt; 0.01) more patients developed postoperative CRPS in the general anesthesia group (n = 25; 24%) and the IVRA lidocaine group (n = 12; 25%) compared with either the axillary block group (n = 5; 5%) or the IVRA lidocaine and clonidine group (n = 3; 6%). We conclude that axillary block or IVRA with clonidine offers a significant advantage for decreasing the incidence of CRPS compared with either IVRA with lidocaine alone or general anesthesia for patients undergoing Dupuytren's surgery.",Anesthesia and analgesia,16428550,2006
Imiquimod: a potential weapon against Dupuytren contracture.,"Dupuytren disease is a proliferative fibroplasia of the subcutaneous palmar tissue, occurring in the form of nodular and cords. Evidence is certainly accumulating for raised levels in Dupuytren's tissue of growth factors known to stimulate fibroblasts, Interleukin-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, prostaglandin-F2, prostaglandin-E2, platelet derived growth factor and connective tissue growth factor have been suggested to have a role. Immune modification of profibrotic cytokines would provide a novel means to treat dupuytren contracture. Imiquimod cream 5% (Aldara) is an immune modifier, that downregulates transforming growth factor-beta and fibroblast growth factor-2 (the two most important cytokine in producing fibrosis).

A review of hand surgery provision in England.,"This study reviews hand surgical activity and the resources available for provision of hand surgery in England in 2001. Operation rates for three common procedures, viz. carpal tunnel release, Dupuytren's surgery and ganglion surgery, were considered. The local population and the number of hand surgeons in each NHS Hospital Trust were compared. We identified 275 consultant surgeons with an interest in hand surgery working in the NHS in England. Approximately two-thirds were orthopaedic surgeons, almost one-third were plastic surgeons and a small number were accident and emergency surgeons. Half of all hand surgeons worked in large units, with three or more hand surgeons, but almost 20% of hand surgery was delivered in hospitals in which there was no surgeon with a declared interest in hand surgery. Surgery rates for Dupuytren's contracture varied from 0.04 to 0.36 cases per 1,000 population per annum and for carpal tunnel syndrome varied from 0.25 to 1.31 cases per 1,000 per annum. We found a correlation between rates of surgery and the number of hand surgeons, locally. A recent audit (Burke, Dias, Heras-Pelou, Bradley, &amp; Wildin, 2004. Providing care for hand disorders, a reappraisal of need. Journal of Hand Surgery, 29B: 575-579.) has suggested that one hand surgeon is required to meet the needs of a population of 125,000, with a national requirement for 393 hand surgeons. We conclude that there are insufficient hand surgeons in England and believe that the wide local variations in hand surgery rates are indicative of a significant unmet demand for hand surgery in the English population.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16368173,2005
A review of common practice in Dupuytren surgery.,"Aspects of decision making, postoperative management, and complications routinely discussed with patients were investigated using a questionnaire completed by 141 hand surgeons of various grades who regularly manage Dupuytren disease. This account presents the results of this questionnaire study, and the literature is discussed in context. A brief description of operative technique in fasciectomy and dermofasciectomy is included. Thresholds for surgery did not differ greatly among the surgeons who completed the questionnaire. The training background and the number of operations performed by surgeons also did not generally influence surgical decision making. Postoperative care regimens were very similar. However, there was great variation in the complications routinely included in discussions with patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren contracture. Recurrence and nerve damage were the only 2 mentioned by almost all surgeons. There was also diversity in what rates were quoted for complications, particularly recurrence (median 33%, range 0%-100%) and stiffness (median 10%, range 0%-100%).",Techniques in hand &amp; upper extremity surgery,16340578,2005
[Dupuytren's contracture -- surgery of recurrencies].,"BACKGROUND: The present study is a retrospective investigation of patients who underwent surgery for recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture. We discuss the indications for this intervention, operative methods, and postoperative therapy. Surgical treatment for recurrence of this condition is incomparably more difficult and risky than the primary operation.METHODS: At the Innsbruck University Clinic for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 50 patients underwent 70 operations for treatment of recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture between March 1999 and September 2004. Thorough pre- and postoperative clinical investigations and assessment of hand status as well as analysis of the indication for the first operation and the surgical method used were carried out. All patients underwent intensive postoperative hand therapy from day 1 for restoration of function and flexibility.RESULTS: After completion of therapy, in 32 patients there was an improved ROM of between 40 and 270 degrees per finger, in five patients an unchanged ROM, and in three patients, reduction in ROM by 5 to 58 degrees; six patients failed to show up for their follow-up despite being asked to do so several times. No data are as yet available on four patients who had undergone primary operation elsewhere and were operated within the past six months for recurrence in our clinic. In nine patients, there was a decrease in sensation immediately after surgery; but improvement was achieved within six months in three of these patients after intensive hand therapy.CONCLUSION: Careful assessment of hand function, establishing the indications for surgery at the right time, choice of the appropriate surgical approach and initiation of intensive hand therapy immediately after surgery are decisive for effective treatment of recurrent Dupuytren's contracture. However, amputations and ray resections cannot be avoided in all cases, especially if nerve injuries incurred during previous operations, resulting in joint stiffness.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",16287015,2005

Mapping of an autosomal dominant gene for Dupuytren's contracture to chromosome 16q in a Swedish family.,"Mapping of an autosomal dominant gene for Dupuytren's contracture to chromosome 16q in a Swedish family.Dupuytren's contracture (DC) (OMIM 126900) is the most common connective tissue disease of mankind and has both heritable and sporadic forms. The inherited form is most frequently observed among the xanthochroi peoples of Northern Europe where its most common manifestations are thickening of the palmar fascia and contracture of the fingers. We ascertained a five-generation Swedish family in which DC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with high, but incomplete, penetrance by the end of the fifth decade. Blood was collected from all affected and informative unaffected family members for the performance of a genome-wide scan at a resolution of approximately 8 cM for all autosomes. Linkage was established to a single 6 cM region between markers D16S419 and D16S3032 on chromosome 16. A maximal two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 3.18 was achieved at microsatellite marker D16S415 with four other markers in the region producing LODs of &gt;1.5.",Clinical genetics,16207209,2005

The complications of Dupuytren's contracture surgery.,"PURPOSE: To determine the complication rate of a modified Skoog's technique in the surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 253 patients who had surgery by 1 surgeon using 1 technique with a mean follow-up period of 3.6 years. We studied the complication rate of the modified Skoog's procedure, relating it to a grading system for disease severity. A separate prospective long-term study was performed with an unselected cohort in which disease recurrence producing contracture was investigated prospectively in a group of 75 patients.RESULTS: Complications occurred in 46 patients. Thirty-five patients had 1 complication and 11 patients had more than 1 complication. Intraoperative complications included 6 patients with nerve injury and 1 patient with an arterial injury. Early postoperative complications before wound healing included 5 patients with digital hematoma, 24 patients with wound infection, 6 patients with sympathetic dystrophy, and 6 patients with skin slough. Late postoperative complications included 3 patients with scar contraction and 2 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. There were 3 non-hand-related complications: 1 urinary retention, 1 left ventricular failure, and 1 myocardial infarction. Recurrence of Dupuytren's disease occurred in 23 of 75 patients after a mean follow-up period of 9.4 years.CONCLUSIONS: The complication rate increased with the severity of disease particularly if the proximal interphalangeal joint contracture was 60 degrees or more. There was no difference in the complication rate for patients who had surgery for primary or recurrent disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,16182062,2005
A retrospective review of the management of Dupuytren's nodules.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the progression of Depuytren's nodules with more than 6 years of follow-up study.METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who presented initially with Dupuytren's nodules returned for physical examination at an average follow-up period of 8.7 years (range, 6-15 y). Patients were questioned regarding family history of Dupuytren's disease, family ethnicity, alcohol consumption, smoking, liver disease, seizures, diabetes, and signs of systemic disease such as knuckle pads and plantar nodules. Physical examination evaluated disease state, loss of extension of the finger joints, and disease location.RESULTS: Thirty of the 59 patients with previously diagnosed isolated nodules developed a cord. Twenty-two percent of patients presented with bilateral disease and another 26% developed bilateral disease. Of those patients whose disease progressed 43% had European heritage, 37% had disease onset before the age of 50 years, 30% had bilateral disease, 23% had a family history of Dupuytren's disease, and 13% had plantar nodules. Five patients lost extension averaging 60 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal joint and 40 degrees at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Three of these 5 had surgical excision because they had a flexion contracture of the metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints averaging 60 degrees and 43 degrees , respectively. Another 7 patients did not meet standard criteria but had surgery for persistent pain associated with grasping objects (without contracture). All surgically treated patients had at least 1 risk factor and 7 patients had more than 1 risk factor. In 7 patients the Dupuytren's nodule had resolved at the time of follow-up evaluation.CONCLUSIONS: The progression of the nodular form of Dupuytren's disease to cord-like disease is common but not inevitable. This evaluation of Dupuytren's nodules has shown that at an average of 8.7 years after diagnosis 5 patients met standard surgical criteria of metacarpophalangeal contracture of greater than 30 degrees or any proximal interphalangeal contracture. Age of onset (before 50 years) is correlated most closely with disease progression, and the disease regressed in 7 patients (12%).",The Journal of hand surgery,16182060,2005
Dupuytren's contracture: an update of biomolecular aspects and therapeutic perspectives.,"The so-called fibrogenic cytokines, able to induce the growth of fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts and to stimulate their production of extracellular matrix, are involved in the genesis of Dupuytren's contracture. Although many studies have been made of biomolecular aspects of palmar fibromatosis, practical applications from them are still far from imminent because of the real difficulty of blocking their action in vivo, even in a chronic, progressive lesion such as Dupuytren's disease. Consequently, surgical excision of the palmar fascia still remains the treatment of choice.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16168532,2005
Recurrence after surgery for Dupuytren's disease: a randomized trial of two skin incisions.,We studied the influence of the type of skin incision on the recurrence rate following fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease. Patients were randomized to a longitudinal incision closed with Z-plasties or a modified Bruner incision closed by Y-V plasties. Follow-up was for at least 2 years or until a recurrence was noted. We found no statistical difference in recurrence rate between patients having these two skin incisions and closures.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16140442,2005
[Work-related musculoskeletal diseases: experience of INAIL of the Apulia region 1998-2001].,"The insurance recognition of Work related Muscolo Skeletal Disorders (WMSDs) has been introduced in Italy by the sentences of Constitutional Court n. 179/1988 and 208/1988. Afterwards the National Insurance Institute against work injuries (INAIL) tried to make homogeneous, in the different INAIL regional Departments, the diagnostic protocol of the work related illness associated with repetitive manual activities. Since 1998, indeed, a clinical diagnostic protocol has been used in the different departments. This report describes the Work related Muscolo Skeletal Disorders submitted to the Apulian INAIL Regional Direction in the period 1998-2001. Among 84 cases of disease reported to the Regional Direction, 21 were recognised as professional illness, the most part of which in workers employed in services sector and mining activities. The most represented disease was carpal tunnel syndrome and it was more recurrent in men than in women, in which the first symptoms were earlier than in men. The most represented risk factor, both in reported and in recognised cases, was the presence of repetitive working movements of the upper extremities, or the combination of the previous one with other risk factors such as high frequency of working activities, postural risk, strength demand, vibrations, climatic conditions. The development of specific diagnostic criteria, the detailed job analysis and the use of specific questionnaires seem to be the main elements for the WMSDs diagnosis and for the recognition of their professional etiology.",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,16124527,2005
Can rock climbing lead to Dupuytren's disease?,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if rock climbing is a significant factor in the development of Dupuytren's disease in men, and, if so, what is the most likely related factor.METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to all 1100 members of the Climbers' Club of Great Britain. These detailed basic information about the climber, the presence of Dupuytren's disease, and any known risk factors for its development.RESULTS: About half (51%) of the questionnaires were returned. The respondents were almost entirely male. It was revealed that 19.5% of male climbers had developed Dupuytren's disease. There was a significantly higher life time intensity of climbing activity in those with the disease. An earlier age of onset of the disease was found in climbers compared with the general population.CONCLUSIONS: This study further strengthens the hypothesis that repetitive trauma to the palmar fascia predisposes to the development of Dupuytren's disease in men.",British journal of sports medicine,16118302,2005

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in Dupuytren's disease.,"The aim of this paper was to examine participation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) signal pathway in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. The study showed changes in the ratio of membrane EGF-R to its intracellular level during the different clinical stages of Dupuytren's contracture progression. Our observations of a high ratio of surface to intracellular EGF-R in the palmar aponeurosis of patients with second degree of Dupuytren's disease (Iselin's classification), which was significantly higher than this ratio in control palmar fascia (P=0.022), would suggest that EGF-R has a role in the involutional phase of the disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",16055243,2005
Clinical associations of Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common progressive fibrotic condition affecting the palmar and digital fascia. Although its management is undertaken by hand surgeons, it is commonly seen by other doctors as an incidental finding. In many cases it is believed to be associated with other medical conditions, although the evidence for such associations is not always clear. This review considers the evidence behind these associations and discusses the aetiology of DD. By doing so, it is hoped that this review will permit a better understanding of the relevance of DD as a clinical sign.",Postgraduate medical journal,15998816,2005
Dupuytren's disease in France--1831 to 2001--from description to economic burden.,"We recorded all elective admissions for Dupuytren's disease from the French National Hospital Database. We used the data from first hospitalizations to calculate the 2001 hospitalization rates for this condition and determine geographical differences between different regions of France. We also calculated the hospital costs of treating admissions with this disease. Fourteen thousand eight hundred and sixty hospitalizations for Dupuytren's disease were reported in France in 2001, of which 93% were for a first treatment. The disease was mostly present in men and was mostly managed by surgical fasciectomy. Most operations were carried out in private hospitals, with a mean stay of 2 days. Geographical differences were found in men only. The total hospital cost for all elective admissions was 14, 179, 998 Euros, indicating the considerable financial burden to the State of treating this condition.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15993524,2005
5-fluorouracil selectively inhibits collagen synthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Fibroproliferative disorders, such as Dupuytren's contracture of the hand, are characterized by excessive production of collagen. 5-Fluorouracil has been used to treat fibroproliferative disorders of the eye and skin and is thought to inhibit thymidylate synthetase blocking DNA replication. 5-Fluorouracil has been shown to down-regulate fibroblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro.METHODS: This study investigated the dose-dependent effect of 5-fluorouracil on fibroblast extracellular matrix production. Fibroblasts were derived from tendon and primary Dupuytren's disease of the hand, a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar aponeurosis (n = 4 patients). Total collagen synthesis was determined by means of the incorporation of radiolabeled proline. Fibroblast secretion of the profibrotic factor transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene expression of collagen types I and III and TGF-beta1 were quantified by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays.RESULTS: The authors found that 5-fluorouracil caused a dose-dependent, selective, and specific decrease in collagen production by Dupuytren's fibroblasts compared with noncollagenous protein synthesis. By contrast, procollagen types I and III mRNA were unaffected by 5-fluorouracil treatment. These changes did not appear to be mediated by alterations in the endogenous secretion of TGF-beta1 or its autocrine effect on collagen metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical implication is that 5-fluorouracil could possibly reduce extracellular matrix production and therefore reduce recurrence of Dupuytren's disease of the hand.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,15988270,2005
Liposomal recombinant human superoxide dismutase for the treatment of Peyronie's disease: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind prospective clinical study.,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a topical gel containing liposomally encapsulated recombinant human Superoxide Dismutase (lrhSOD) in the treatment of painful Peyronie's Disease. The theoretical background is that lrhSOD, by scavenging of free oxygen radicals, might interrupt inflammatory cascades and thereby limit further disease progression.METHODS: In a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 39 patients with Peyronie's Disease and significant pain symptoms were treated with lrhSOD or placebo for a 4 week period. At this time, statistical evaluation of pain resolution was performed as primary study endpoint. Patients then were continued in a cross-over study design to ensure a total of 8 weeks of lrhSOD therapy for all study participants. Pain, plaque and curvature assessment was performed at study entry and every 4 weeks until week 12.RESULTS: LrhSOD treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain (p=0.017) compared to placebo already after 4 weeks. At week 12 pain was significantly reduced in 89% of patients who all had received 8 weeks of lrhSOD therapy at that time. Response to other disease parameters was assessed at week 12: plaque size was reduced in 47% of patients, as was plaque consistence in 38%. Penile curvature was improved at 5-30 degrees in 23% of patients. The expected spontaneous disease progression rate of up to 40%, as reported by several investigators, was significantly reduced to &lt;10% under lrhSOD therapy, and patients satisfaction was high, also consequent to the lack of therapy-related side effects observed in the present study.CONCLUSION: LrhSOD is an easily administrable, safe and effective local therapeutic for the painful phase of Peyronie's Disease.",European urology,15982798,2005

"Dupuytren's contracture; increased cellularity--proliferation, is there equality?","BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a chronic inflammatory process which causes contractures of the fingers by shortening and thickening the palmar fascia. During the proliferative phase, fibroblasts transform into myofibroblasts apparently under the influence of several different factors. The disease usually develops slowly, but in some patients it tends to develop aggressively. The pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease remains unsolved. In this study, we analyzed some histological characteristics that seem to predict rapid recurrence.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 21 patients were divided into two groups. In 11 patients the disease was classified as aggressive because it had recurred within two years after an operation. In 10 cases it was non-aggressive, as no recurrence had been seen. Five control samples were taken from healthy palmar aponeurosis. The differences in cellularity, collagen, Ki-67, MSA, alpha-SMA and tenascin between the specimens were analyzed using immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Alpha-SMA and Ki-67 were present more often in the aggressive specimens. Immunohistochemical stainings for macrophages and lymphocytes were negative.CONCLUSION: There may be differences in the histology and/or immunohistochemical appearance of pathological palmar connective tissue cords in aggressive and normal Dupuytren's disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease.",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,15865122,2005
Alterations in the extracellular matrix proteoglycan profile in Dupuytren's contracture affect the palmar fascia.,"Dupuytren's disease is a palmar fibromatosis associated with changes in fibroblast activity that also affect the metabolism of extracellular matrix components. In contrast to disease connected alterations in collagen and non-collagenous glycoproteins (mainly fibronectin), the metabolism of proteoglycans, being glycosaminoglycan modified glycoproteins, is poorly understood. Thus, the aim of the present study was the characterization of matrix proteoglycans (PGs) derived from normal fascia and Dupuytren's fascia. Extracted and purified PGs (particularly small PGs) were analysed for content, molecular mass, immunoreactivity and glycosaminoglycan chain structure. The matrix of normal fascia mainly contains decorin [small dermatan sulfate (DS) PG] with biglycan (another small DSPG) and large chondroitin sulfate(CS)/DSPG representing minor components. Dupuytren's disease is associated with the remodeling of matrix PG composition. The most prominent alteration is an accumulation of biglycan frequently bearing DS chains with higher molecular masses. Moreover, the amount of large CS/DSPG is increased. In contrast, decorin displays changes affecting mainly DS chain structure reflected in (i) an increase in some chain molecular masses, (ii) an enhanced content of iduronate disaccharide clusters, and (iii) oversulfation of disaccharide repeats. The PG alterations observed in Dupuytren's fascia may influence the matrix properties and contribute to disease progression.",Journal of biochemistry,15858170,2005

Dupuytren's fasciectomies in 60 consecutive digits using lidocaine with epinephrine and no tourniquet.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a common hand problem. Its treatment, other than percutaneous fasciectomy, is an outpatient operation performed with the patient under regional or general anesthesia. If local anesthetics are used, they are used without epinephrine, and an arm or forearm tourniquet is essential. Multiple reviews have described the safety of local anesthetics with epinephrine in the digits. This study is a retrospective review of operations performed by the same surgeon in the hospital (43 digits) versus the office using local anesthetics with epinephrine and no tourniquet (60 digits). Results and complications were compared and tabulated. The hospital and epinephrine groups were comparable regarding preoperative measurements. Postoperative improvement in extension at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints was similar in both the hospital and epinephrine groups. Complications, including digital nerve and artery injuries, infections, and hematomas, were similar between the groups. There were no cases of digital necrosis or gangrene in the epinephrine group, even though one patient sustained a transection of a digital artery at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Because of the similarities in results and complications, there does not seem to be an advantage to performing Dupuytren's excisions with full arm tourniquet and outpatient admission in many cases. Local anesthetics with epinephrine are safe in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture, although both the use of digital epinephrine and the use of mechanical tourniquets carry the potential for complications. Visibility is similar to that for facial or head and neck surgery and is aided by the use of loupe magnification. The old dogma against its use in the fingers is refuted, as seen by the results in these 60 consecutive Dupuytren's fasciectomies and the results of other authors.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,15731682,2005

A cohort study linked increased mortality in patients treated surgically for Dupuytren's contracture.,"OBJECTIVE: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a fibromatous disease of the palmar fascia of unknown etiology. The objective of this study was to assess whether individuals treated for DC exhibited an altered standardized mortality ratio.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 16,517 patients operated on for DC between 1965 and 1995 were identified by the Swedish Inpatient Register. For the 7,579 patients who had died during that period, cause of death was obtained from the Swedish Death Register.RESULTS: There was an overall increased mortality (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]=1.06), inversely related to age and significant for both sexes, in patients under 70 years of age. The risk estimate was highest for endocrine diseases (highest value in patients 40-49 years of age at surgery; SMR=2.82), gastrointestinal diseases (highest value in those 40-49 years of age at surgery; SMR=2.69), accidents (highest value in those 30-39 years of age at surgery; SMR=2.40), and respiratory diseases (highest value in those 50-59 years of age at surgery; SMR=1.61). There was also an increased SMR for cardiovascular diseases in patients 40-59 years of age more than 10 years after surgery (highest value in those 40-49 years of age at surgery; SMR=1.65).CONCLUSION: The most probable mechanism for the increased mortality is related to smoking and other lifestyle factors.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,15649673,2005
Identification of a novel mitochondrial mutation in Dupuytren's disease using multiplex DHPLC.,"Dupuytren's disease is a familial fibroproliferative disorder of late onset affecting the hands. It is extremely common in individuals of Northern European extraction. Genetic studies have yet to identify the genes involved in the formation of the disease. Mitochondria play a critical role in cell metabolism and apoptosis. It is known that defective mitochondria generate abnormally high levels of reactive oxygen species by means of electron leak and that antioxidant enzyme activities decrease with age in skin fibroblasts. Respiratory function of mitochondria is also impaired in aging human tissues. Oxidative stress and production of free radicals may be important factors in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. Mitochondrial genes are also included in the regulation of apoptosis. Diseased tissue contains large numbers of myo- fibroblasts, which disappear by apoptosis during normal wound healing. High numbers of mitochondria have been observed in fibroblasts derived from diseased tissue. In the light of this evidence, the mitochondrial genome represents a potential location for candidate susceptibility genes for this late-onset disorder. In this study, the authors investigated the presence of mutations within the mitochondrial genome in 40 subjects; 20 Caucasian Dupuytren's disease patients with a maternally transmitted inheritance pattern and 20 control subjects were matched for age, sex, and race using a multiplex denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography approach. A hitherto unknown heteroplasmic mutation located within the mitochondrial 16s rRNA region was evident in 90 percent of patients and absent from all control subjects (p &lt; 0.001; chi2 = 16.1). This mutation may be important in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,15622243,2004
Epidermal growth factor in Dupuytren's disease.,"The aim of this article was to show the participation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease (palmar contracture). The concentration of EGF in specimens obtained from 68 patients with Dupuytren's contracture and 14 controls was examined immunochemically with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The determined EGF concentration in pathologic aponeurosis with symptoms of Dupuytren's disease (median, 6.29 ng/g; range, 1.67 to 63.09 ng/g) showed significantly different values (p = 0.036) in comparison with the control group (median, 10.1 ng/g; range, 5.13 to 39.81 ng/g). The changes in EGF concentration were shown in tested groups of pathologic tissues that were formed according to the clinical stage of disease progression. The significantly lower concentration than that seen in the control group characterizes tissues with first and third degrees of palmar contracture progression (p = 0.025 and p = 0.018, respectively). In the group of patients with second-degree disease progression, the EGF level increased transiently. Nevertheless, in comparison with the other groups, the difference was not significant. The group with the fourth degree of the disease showed EGF concentrations that resembled the control values. The authors conclude that significant differences in levels of EGF concentration between contractured and normal fasciae may suggest the participation of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,15622242,2004

Two individuals showed pathological condition affecting joints. It was supposed that first individual had been suffering from Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. It seems that this condition remained untreated, with extensive bone remodeling, and that the deformity of femoral head and acetabulum caused secondary degenerative joint disease at a relatively early age of this individual. Second case was related to the bony akylosis of the hand finger, probably caused by Dupuytren's disease.

Enhanced Dupuytren's disease fibroblast populated collagen lattice contraction is independent of endogenous active TGF-beta2.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a debilitating fibro-proliferative disorder of the hand characterized by the appearance of fibrotic lesions (nodules and cords) leading to flexion contractures of the fingers and loss of hand function. Although the molecular mechanism of DD is unknown, it has been suggested that transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) may play an important role in the underlying patho-physiology of the disease. The purpose of this study was to further explore this hypothesis by examining the effects of TGF-beta2 on primary cell cultures derived from patient-matched disease and normal palmar fascia tissue using a three-dimensional collagen contraction assay.METHODS: Fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL) contraction assays using primary cell cultures derived from diseased and control fascia of the same DD patients were studied in response to exogenous TGF-beta2 and neutralizing anti-TGF-beta2 antibodies.RESULTS: Contraction of the FPCLs occurred significantly faster and to a greater extent in disease cells compared to control cells. The addition of TGF-beta2 enhanced the rate and degree of collagen contraction in a dose-dependent fashion for both control and diseased cells. Neutralizing anti-TGF-beta2 antibodies abolished exogenous TGF-beta2 stimulated collagen contraction, but did not inhibit the enhanced basal collagen contraction activity of disease FPCL cultures.CONCLUSIONS: Although exogenous TGF-beta2 stimulated both disease and control FPCL contraction, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta2 antibodies did not affect the elevated basal collagen contraction activity of disease FPCLs, suggesting that the differences in the collagen contraction activity of control and disease FPCL cultures are not due to differences in the levels of endogenous TGF-beta2 activity.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,15541177,2004
A prospective study linked both alcohol and tobacco to Dupuytren's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To address the role of alcohol intake and tobacco smoking and the combination of the two on subsequent risk of Dupuytren's disease.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study of 7,254 subjects enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (1981-1983). Both self-reported information on lifestyle and objective measures at the baseline examination were linked to presence of Dupuytren's disease at a subsequent examination (1991-1994) using multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: A total of 772 subjects had signs of Dupuytren's disease at follow-up. After adjustment for age, sex, educational level, diabetes, and either alcohol or tobacco consumption, respectively, odds ratios for having the disease increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing levels of alcohol or tobacco intake; however, there was no statistical interaction between heavy smoking and heavy drinking.CONCLUSION: Alcohol intake and tobacco smoking are independently associated with increased risk of Dupuytren's disease, and the combination of the two conveys a very large risk.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,15485739,2004
[The diabetic hand].,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by persistent hyperglycaemia with resultant morbidity and mortality related to its microvascular and macrovascular complications. In addition diabetes is also associated with several musculoskeletal disorders of the hand, that can be debilitating. There is increased incidence of these abnormalities in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the general population, related to disease duration but not to the age or sex. Typical diabetes associated hand condition include the palmar flexor tenosynovitis, Dupuytren's contracture, syndrome of limited joint mobility, carpal tunnel syndrome, Charcot arthropathy and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Maintaining good glycaemic control by exercise, diet and drugs improves or prevents the development of these hand rheumatic condition. In this brief report we review the rational therapeutic approach to these disorders.",Reumatismo,15470518,2004
Expression of bone morphogenetic proteins by Dupuytren's fibroblasts.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, are the primary cell type in Dupuytren's disease. Growth factors play a role in the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are specialized fibroblasts that display morphologic and biochemical features similar to smooth muscle cells. Cytokines, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components are all thought to play a role in myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Recent research has shown that specific cytokines, such as transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), can modulate myofibroblast expression. We hypothesize that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a role in the modulation of Dupuytren's fibroblasts.METHODS: Dupuytren's fibroblasts and normal palmar fascia fibroblasts (control) were analyzed for messenger RNA expression of BMPs (BMP-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10 and -11), their receptors (BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and BMPR-II), and their antagonists (follistatin and noggin) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Western blot analysis and immunostaining also were used to confirm the differential expression of BMP-4.RESULTS: With reverse-transcription PCR the expression profile for normal palmar fascia fibroblasts versus Dupuytren's fibroblasts was found to show similar expression of BMP-1 and -11; qualitatively decreased expression of BMP-6, BMP-8, BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and BMPR-II in Dupuytren's fibroblasts; and no expression of BMP-4 in Dupuytren's fibroblasts. There was no expression of BMP-2, -3, -5, -7, -9, and -10 in both the control fibroblasts and Dupuytren's fibroblasts. In line with the messenger RNA expression pattern BMP-4 was detected in only the control fibroblasts and not in the Dupuytren's fibroblasts, whereas BMP-8 (chosen for comparison purposes) was detectable in both cell populations. Immunostaining for BMP-8 and BMP-4 confirmed our findings with reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot analysis.CONCLUSIONS: This study reports on the expression of BMPs in Dupuytren's fibroblasts. We characterized the expression of BMPs in both normal palmar fascia fibroblasts and in Dupuytren's fibroblasts through reverse-transcription PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunostaining. The most significant difference in expression profiles was in the expression of BMP-4; that is, BMP-4 was expressed in the normal fibroblasts but not in the Dupuytren's fibroblasts. Whether BMP-4 is necessary and/or sufficient for maintaining a normal palmar fascia fibroblast phenotype is not yet known. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact role of BMPs, and especially BMP-4, in Dupuytren's fibroblasts.",The Journal of hand surgery,15465229,2004
Functional outcome after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture: a prospective study.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the functional outcome after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture and the correlation between the change in the degree of deformity of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) and the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) and the change in hand function.METHODS: Hand function in 30 patients was assessed by Sollerman hand function tests prospectively both before surgery and at 6 and 12 months after surgery. The deformity at the MCPJ and PIPJ was measured in degrees of angulation. The results were analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation test. In patients with multiple finger involvement the data were analyzed twice: first by using the measurements for the finger with the worst deformity and then repeating the analysis after the mean deformity was calculated.RESULTS: The mean preoperative MCPJ and PIPJ deformity was 31 degrees (range, 30 degrees to 76 degrees ) and 35 degrees (range, 30 degrees to 96 degrees ), respectively. The mean correction at the MCPJ and PIPJ was 19.6 degrees and 16 degrees , respectively. The mean preoperative Sollerman score was 72.8, which improved to 77.9 at 12 months after surgery. There was a statistically significant correlation between the total correction, PIPJ correction, and hand function at 6 and 12 months, but not with MCPJ correction. In those patients with multiple finger involvement these correlations remained true regardless of whether the mean or greatest deformity was considered.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that improvement in deformity in Dupuytren's contracture leads to an improvement in hand function and that an improvement in the PIPJ contracture has a greater correlation with hand function than an improvement in the MCPJ contracture.",The Journal of hand surgery,15465228,2004
An objective method to evaluate the risk of recurrence and extension of Dupuytren's disease.,This study was undertaken to assess the influence of the factors related to Dupuytren's diathesis on the rates of recurrence and extension of Dupuytren's disease after surgery. The records of 65 patients who underwent surgery for Dupuytren's disease were retrospectively studied and the presence of factors related to diathesis were recorded. The sensitivity and specificity of each factor for predicting recurrence and extension were calculated. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated and a discriminant analysis was performed to explore correlations between recurrence and extension and the significant variables. Our results confirmed the prognostic value of diathesis. The results have been used to develop a new scoring system for evaluating the risk of recurrence and extension.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15336743,2004
Dupuytren's disease risk factors.,"Dupuytren's is a common problem, but little is known about its aetiology. We have undertaken a large case-control study to assess and quantify the relative contributions of diabetes and epilepsy as risk factors for Dupuytren's in the community. Cases were patients with a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease and, for each, two controls were individually matched by age, sex, and general practice. Our dataset included 821 cases and 1,642 controls. Five hundred and eighty-eight (72%) of the cases were men. The mean age at diagnosis was 62 (range 24-97) years. Diabetes was a significant risk factor for Dupuytren's disease (OR=1.75) and there was an increased risk for medicinally treated diabetes (metformin--OR=3.56; sulphonylureas--OR=1.75) and particularly insulin controlled (OR=4.38) rather than diet-controlled diabetes. Epilepsy (OR=1.12) and anti-epileptic medications were not associated with Dupuytren's disease. Ascertainment bias in previous studies may explain the reported association with epilepsy.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15336742,2004
A histological and anatomical profile of pacinian corpuscles from Dupuytren's contracture and the expression of nerve growth factor receptor.,"The etiology of Dupuytren's disease is unknown. The causes of the fibroplastic response of nodules, fibrosis of cords, and prominence of pacinian corpuscles are not evident. Histological and immunohistology differences in pacinian corpuscles from the hands of five patients with Dupuytren's disease compared with 17 Dupuytren's-free patients are presented. Histological sections of pacinian corpuscle specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained for nerve growth factor receptor. The length and width of intact pacinian corpuscles were measured, and the number of layers within each corpuscle was counted and recorded. Grossly, the pacinian corpuscles from Dupuytren's patients were larger and more numerous compared with those from unaffected patients. When measured microscopically, the pacinian corpuscles from Dupuytren's diseased fascia were significantly larger (2.0 x 1.1 mm) compared with controls (1.5 x 0.78 mm). The pacinian corpuscles from Dupuytren's-affected patients had significantly more layers (64 +/- 14) compared with those from control patients (40 +/- 9). Nerve growth factor receptor staining of pacinian corpuscles from patients affected with Dupuytren's disease showed greater intensity and more area stained compared with unaffected controls. It is suggested that nerve growth factor may be involved in the increased size of pacinian corpuscles in Dupuytren's-affected fascia. It is proposed that the cellular outgrowth from pacinian corpuscles may generate the cells that develop into Dupuytren's nodules.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,15318052,2004
Comparison of gene expression profiles between Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren's contracture.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the gene expression alterations in human Peyronie's disease (PD) and Dupuytren's disease (DD) to determine whether they share a common pathophysiology. Multiple mRNA expression profiles of human PD have previously shown that genes that regulate fibroblast replication, myofibroblast differentiation, collagen metabolism, tissue repair, and ossification are involved. DD, a palmar fascia fibrosis, may be associated with PD.METHODS: Total RNA samples from PD plaques, normal tunica albuginea, Dupuytren's nodules, and normal palmar fascia (nine samples per group) were subjected to differential gene expression profile analysis (Clontech Atlas DNA microarray) comparing PD with tunica albuginea and DD with normal palmar fascia. Changes of more than 2.0 in PD and DD compared with tunica albuginea and normal palmar fascia, respectively, were recorded. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were performed for some genes whose expression was altered in PD.RESULTS: Some of the gene families upregulated in both PD and DD were (a) collagen degradation: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), with MMP2 and MMP9, and thymosins (MMP activators), with TMbeta10 and TMbeta4; (b) ossification: osteoblast-specific factors (OSFs) OSF-1 and OSF-2 (DD only); and (c) myofibroblast differentiation: RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor 1. The genes upregulated in PD only were decorin (an inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta1 and a part of fibroblast replication/collagen synthesis) and early growth response protein. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed these changes.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the pattern of alterations in the expression of certain gene families in PD and DD is similar, suggesting that they share a common pathophysiology and may be amenable to the same therapeutic regimens.",Urology,15302515,2004
Increased formation of pyridinoline cross-links due to higher telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase levels is a general fibrotic phenomenon.,"Fibrosis is characterized by an excessive accumulation of collagen which contains increased levels of pyridinoline cross-links. The occurrence of pyridinolines in the matrix is an important criterion in assessing the irreversibility of fibrosis, which suggests that collagen containing pyridinoline cross-links significantly contributes to the unwanted collagen accumulation. Pyridinoline cross-links are derived from hydroxylated lysine residues located within the collagen telopeptides (hydroxyallysine pathway). Here, we have investigated whether the increase in hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links in fibrotic conditions can be ascribed to an increased expression of one of the lysyl hydroxylases (LH1, LH2 with its splice variants LH2a and LH2b, or LH3) and/or to an increased expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX). In fibroblast cultures of hypertrophic scars, keloid and palmar fascia of Dupuytren's patients, as well as in activated hepatic stellate cells, increased levels of LH2b mRNA expression were observed. Only minor amounts of LH2a were present. In addition, no consistent increase in the mRNA expression levels of LH1, LH3 and LOX could be detected, suggesting that LH2b is responsible for the overhydroxylation of the collagen telopeptides and the concomitant formation of pyridinolines as found in the collagen matrix deposited in long-term cultures by the same fibrotic cells. This is consistent with our previous observation that LH2b is a telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase. We conclude that the increased expression of LH2b, leading to the increased formation of pyridinoline cross-links, is present in a wide variety of fibrotic disorders and thus represents a general fibrotic phenomenon.",Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology,15296939,2004
Dupuytren's disease on the radial aspect of the hand: report on 135 hands in Japanese patients.,"We studied 135 hands in 77 Japanese patients to assess the frequency of radial involvement and its association with recurrence and the Dupuytren's diathesis. The radial aspect of the hand was affected in 22% of the hands. Diseased cords were observed in ten patients who underwent surgery on the radial aspect of the hand. Longitudinal cords on the radial side of thenar eminence and distal transverse interdigital cords were common. The radial aspect of the hand was the most common site of disease extension, though recurrence never occurred after excision of a radial lesion. Ectopic lesions, bilateral hand involvement, and recurrence were significantly more frequent in patients with the radial side involvement. Thus the results of this study suggest that radial side disease is associated with the Dupuytren's diathesis and is a risk factor of recurrence.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15234500,2004
[Genetic aspect of Dupuytren's diseases].,"Dupuytren's disease is a connective tissue disorder leading to the shortening of the palmar aponeurosis and progressive digital flexion deformity. Despite decades of both scientific and clinical investigations the precise etiology and tissue origin of Dupuytren's disease remains unclear. Several authors focused their studies on the genetics of Dupuytren's disease and postulated either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The limited number of members of families affected with the disease makes it difficult to determine the mode of inheritance. A particular difficulty is the late age of the onset of Dupuytren's disease, which in most cases limits examination to two generations. Age-related, dominant inheritance is a mode favored by several authors whereas others consider autosomal recessive inheritance as a possible explanation for sporadic cases of Dupuytren's disease. A gene that increases susceptibility to the disease may do so by rendering the tissue more sensitive to the effects of environmental exposures. This article summarizes current studies on various modes of inheritance in Dupuytren's disease.","Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",15181751,2004
Severe contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease: does capsuloligamentous release improve outcome?,"This prospective study assessed whether patients with severe proximal interphalangeal joint contracture (#10878;60 degrees ) due to Dupuytren's disease which persisted after fasciectomy alone benefited from an additional capsuloligamentous release. Forty-three patients with 43 severely contracted proximal interphalangeal joints underwent operative correction followed by a standardized postoperative rehabilitation programme. All were followed for 6 months. In 11 patients correction of the proximal interphalangeal joint to 20 degrees could not be achieved by fasciectomy alone, and an additional capsuloligamentous release was performed which effectively corrected all their residual flexion contractures. There were no statistically significant differences between the capsulotomy and the non-capsulotomy group with respect to the residual proximal interphalangeal joint contracture at the end of surgery, or at their last follow-up examination.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15142694,2004
Surgery for Dupuytren's disease in Japanese patients and a new preoperative classification.,The surgical outcome of Dupuytren's disease was evaluated in 73 hands of 57 patients in a Japanese population. Subtotal fasciectomy was performed in all cases. Surgical results were evaluated using the percentage improvement of extension in each finger joint. Statistical analyses were performed on the risk factors associated with recurrence and extension. The surgical outcome depended on the degree of contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Recurrence of disease occurred in eight patients (14%) and extension occurred in nine (16%). Recurrence and extension frequently occurred in those who had ectopic lesions or involvement of the radial side of the hand. The present results suggested that the Dupuytren's diathesis had an influence on recurrence and extension. We proposed a new classification of Dupuytren's disease that might help to predict the surgical outcome and facilitate surgical planning.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",15142693,2004
Elective hand surgery in patients taking warfarin.,"We reviewed 22 patients who had undergone either carpal tunnel decompression or release of Dupuytren's contractures while anticoagulated with warfarin.

Abductor digiti minimi involvement in Dupuytren's contracture of the small finger.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a common, benign, progressive condition. Patterns of involvement of the ulnar side of the hand, specifically the involvement of the abductor digiti minimi (ADM), have received limited attention; therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, patterns of involvement, and surgical outcomes in DC of the small finger.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the hands of all patients who had surgery for DC between January 1998 and March 2002 to determine the incidence of ADM involvement.RESULTS: A total of 149 patients had 195 surgeries on 261 digits during this period. Forty-seven percent of cases involved the small finger and 27% of those involved the ADM. Those cases involving the ADM had statistically significantly greater mean preoperative proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) contracture (53 degrees ) as well as postoperative PIPJ contracture (34 degrees ) when compared with those without ADM involvement of the small finger (31 degrees preoperative PIPJ contracture and 15 degrees postoperative PIPJ contracture, respectively). The most common origin pattern of the ADM involvement was found to arise from both the ADM tendon and overlying fascia (77%). The most common insertion pattern was found to be over the middle phalanx (50%).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ADM is involved in DC of the small finger in one quarter of cases. Failure to recognize and resect the diseased cord arising from it and its overlying fascia at the time of surgery may account for the poor outcomes seen in DC of the small finger.",The Journal of hand surgery,15140497,2004
Dupuytren's disease in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An epidemiological study.,"BACKGROUND: It is generally held that Dupuytren's disease is more common in northern than in southern Europe, but there are very few studies from southern European countries.METHODS: We examined the hands of 1207 men and women over the age of 50 years in Bosnia and Herzegovina.RESULTS: The prevalence of Dupuytren's disease was highly age-dependent, ranging from 17% for men between 50-59 years to 60% in the oldest men. The prevalence among women was lower. The great majority only had palmar changes without contracture of the digit. The prevalence was significantly lower among Bosnian Muslim men than among Bosnian Croat and Serbian men and significantly increased among diabetics. No association could be detected between Dupuytren's disease and smoking, alcohol consumption or living in rural or urban areas.CONCLUSION: We conclude that, contrary to previous opinion, Dupuytren's disease is common in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,15050031,2004
Wound healing-associated proteins Hsp47 and fibronectin are elevated in Dupuytren's contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture or disease (DD) affects hand function by causing irreversible contraction of the palmar fascia. Histological analysis has shown that DD and wound granulation tissue share many cellular and biochemical characteristics, suggesting that DD may be an exaggerated wound-healing response. The goal of the present study was to examine the possible involvement of two important wound-healing-associated proteins-heat shock protein 47 (Hsp47), fibronectin (Fn), and its oncofetal isoforms-in DD, using clinical tissue samples and primary cell cultures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the expression of Hsp47, Fn, and an oncofetal isoform of fibronectin (IIICS) in both normal and disease-matched surgical specimens and primary cell cultures using Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry (ICC).RESULTS: Our results indicate that Hsp47 and total fibronectin is elevated in DD lesional tissue. In addition, Western and ICC analysis of patient-matched (normal and disease) primary cultures show significantly elevated levels of oncofetal fibronectin (IIICS spliced variant) within disease primary cell cultures.CONCLUSIONS: The high levels of expression of Hsp47 and adult and oncofetal fibronectin in DD suggests that cell-mediated alterations in the extracellular environment may play an important role in the disease process. Furthermore, the involvement of these wound healing-associated proteins in DD supports the notion that this disease may be an exaggerated form of wound healing.",The Journal of surgical research,15047128,2004
[Outpatient hand surgery--possibilities and limitations].,"On January 1st 2004, a new contract between the government, health insurance services, and hospitals was inaugurated in Germany. The aim of the contract is to decrease costs for surgical therapies by abolishing or at least minimizing hospitalization of patients. Hand surgery is widely affected by the new contract, since a very large part of surgical therapies for the hand was declared to be compulsory outdoor and another major part to be preferable outdoor. The surgeon may decide whether a patient needs inpatient or outpatient treatment but has to justify his decision. Hospitals and surgical clinics are both allowed to offer outpatient hand surgery and get the same payment under the same regulations. For most hospitals, structural changes will be necessary to offer outpatient surgery without financial loss. In our experience a personal and regular contact between patient and surgeon is most necessary for the best surgical result. Many of the compulsory outpatient operations in hand surgery can be done sufficiently and at high standard. This may not be the case for the second group to be handled not compulsory outdoor. The new contract allows hospitals to offer postoperative care for only 14 days, whereas many specific hand surgical procedures will need the surgeon's control and care for a much longer time. On the other hand, clinics and general practitioners have strict limitations for the prescription of hand therapies. We believe that the quality of hand surgery is highly dependent on sufficient postoperative treatment. If the postoperative care is neglected or restricted, secondary costs such as sick leave will increase.",Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift fur alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen,15021946,2004

Although 85% contained accurate information, in 65% this information was incomplete. Eighty-seven per cent of websites were accountable for the information presented, but only 24% made references to reliable sources.

The contractile properties and responses to tensional loading of Dupuytren's disease--derived fibroblasts are altered: a cause of the contracture?,"Dupuytren's disease causes disability because of the development of finger flexion deformities, with distinct nodule and cord formation. This results in physical shortening of the diseased fascial tissue through a combination of cell-mediated contraction and matrix remodeling. It is this fixed tissue fabric shortening that prevents finger extension. In this experimental study, the relative contractile properties of Dupuytren nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts were quantified in a culture force monitor model, in comparison with normal carpal ligament fibroblasts. Nine nodule, 10 cord, and four carpal ligament fibroblast cell lines were studied; each cell line was derived from a separate patient. The contractile forces generated by nodule and cord fibroblasts were significantly greater than the force generated by carpal ligament fibroblasts. There were also significant differences between nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts, with the nodule cells demonstrating the greatest contractile force generation. The contraction profiles of both cord and nodule Dupuytren fibroblasts demonstrated delays in the attainment of tensional homeostasis, with an absence of a plateau phase by 20 hours. After the contraction phase, cell-seeded constructs were subjected to a series of four uniaxial mechanical overloads and cellular responses were monitored during each subsequent 30-minute period. Dupuytren nodule and cord fibroblast responses were significantly altered, compared with carpal ligament fibroblasts, exhibiting an increased and opposite response. Dupuytren fibroblasts, particularly nodule fibroblasts, exhibited increased force generation and a delay in reaching tensional homeostasis. The data suggest that these cells have an inherently higher basal tension and contractile ability. This results in increased shortening of the matrix, and the delay in reaching tensional homeostasis might exacerbate this response. These results represent a theoretical framework regarding the fundamental processes involved in the pathogenesis and progression of clinical flexion deformities in Dupuytren disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,14758224,2004
The surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture: a synthesis of techniques.,"Dupuytren's disease is an affliction of the palmar fascia. Selective fasciectomy is recommended once contracture has occurred. Alternatives for wound closure include tissue rearrangement, the open palm technique, and full-thickness skin grafting. In this prospective study, a new &quot;synthesis&quot; technique was used to treat a cohort of patients with advanced Dupuytren's disease. The results were then compared with those of a second cohort of patients who underwent the open palm technique. Thirty consecutive patients were selected. Ten patients (nine men and one woman; average age, 67 years) underwent the open palm technique, and 20 patients (18 men and two women; average age, 70 years) underwent the synthesis method. Follow-up was 3.5 years for the open palm group and 2.7 years for the synthesis group. All patients in both groups improved with respect to motion, function, appearance, and satisfaction. Objectively, for the open palm technique, metacarpophalangeal joint contracture decreased from 50 degrees to 0 degrees, and proximal interphalangeal joint contracture decreased from 40 degrees to 6 degrees. Using the synthesis method, metacarpophalangeal joint contracture decreased from 57 degrees to 0 degrees, and proximal interphalangeal joint contracture decreased from 58 degrees to 10 degrees. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Test scores decreased from 37 to 30 in both groups. There were no significant differences between groups in these parameters. The two significant intergroup differences were healing time (40 days for the open palm technique versus 28 days for the synthesis method) and recurrence rate (50 percent for open palm versus 0 percent for synthesis). The synthesis technique combines with success the best features of current methods for the surgical treatment of advanced Dupuytren's disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,14758215,2004
Hand surgery in organ transplant patients.,"PURPOSE: This study presents a series of organ transplant patients who developed problems that affected their upper extremities, related to the organ transplant operation itself, to the patient's underlying systemic disease, to long-term immunosuppression, or to subsequent hand injury after the organ transplant surgery.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 40 organ transplant patients with upper extremity problems at 3 major organ transplant centers was performed.RESULTS: Six general problems were identified that affected the hand and upper extremity in these transplant patients: inflammatory conditions (16), nerve compression syndromes (18), infections (6), neoplasms (6), vascular problems (4), and trauma (14). Thirty-eight patients had 72 separate hand procedures. No problems were encountered with postoperative infections, and skin and bony healing occurred uneventfully.CONCLUSIONS: Organ transplant patients are prone to developing atypical infections, skin malignancies, ischemia, and various nerve compression syndromes that affect the hand.

Hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of early-phase Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a proliferative disorder of autosomal-dominant inheritance, with variable penetrance of gene expression. The treatment of DD is challenging. Both operative and nonoperative approaches were reported for treatment of the disease, but no perfect approach has gained popularity as the best choice of treatment. Most of the emphasis has been placed on surgical techniques, but outcomes were reported to be dependent on some variables such as case selection, timing of surgery, and the surgeon's training and experience. In this paper, we report on a hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment for early-phase DD. HBO treatment was applied to a female aged 23 years who had a mild form of DD. Physical findings and complaints before and after HBO treatment were compared. Total relief of symptoms as well as physical findings were obtained with HBO treatment. HBO for the treatment of DD is a novel concept. Having treated only one case is not enough to conclude that HBO is the only effective mode of treatment for DD. HBO should also be tried to treat early-phase or mild contractures of DD. Unfortunately, HBO has a disadvantage, i.e., cost. But HBO is not invasive, and because of the nature of HBO treatment, most of the complications seen after surgeries, e.g., wound-healing problems, damage to the digital nerves and vessels, buttonholing of the skin, and tendon sheath opening, are not seen.",Microsurgery,14748021,2004

Patients with two-digit disease were randomized to having 5-fluorouracil (25mg/ml) treatment for 5 minutes on one digit and placebo on the other. Fifteen patients were enrolled with 18 months follow-up. There were no peri-operative complications. Wound healing was not delayed and there was no deterioration in the flexion deformity of the 5-fluorouracil treated digits. Patients were subsequently assessed by joint angle measurement at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. There was no significant difference between control and 5-fluorouracil treated digits.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",14734063,2004
Proximal interphalangeal joint release in Dupuytren's disease of the little finger.,"We present a prospective study, with 3-year follow-up, of the role and outcome of fasciectomy plus sequential surgical release of structures of the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's contracture of the little finger. Our treatment programme involves fasciectomy for all patients followed by sequential release of the accessory collateral ligament and volar plate as necessary. Of the 19 fingers in the study, eight achieved a full correction by fasciectomy alone, and in these cases there was a fixed flexion deformity of 6 degrees at 3 months and 8 degrees at 3 years. The remaining 11 fingers (initial mean deformity 70 degrees flexion) were left with a fixed flexion deformity of 42 degrees after fasciectomy which reduced to 7 degrees with capsulo-ligamentous release. This increased to 26 degrees at 3 months but then remained relatively stable, increasing only to 29 degrees at 3 years. In our experience sequential proximal interphalangeal joint release has led to consistently good results with few complications in the correction of severe Dupuytren's disease of the little finger.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",14734062,2004
The role of manual occupation in the aetiology of Dupuytren's disease in men in England and Wales.,"We compared the incidence of significant Dupuytren's disease in men across occupational social classes in England and Wales, using data from the National Morbidity Survey. We found that manual occupational social class was not associated with an increased incidence of Dupuytren's disease. In fact, the incidence rates of Dupuytren's disease in the elderly were higher in non-manual than in manual social classes.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",14734061,2004
[Radiation therapy for Morbus Ledderhose -- indication and clinical results].,"BACKGROUND: Morbus Ledderhose (ML) is a rare hyperproliferative disorder of the plantar aponeurosis which is similar in its clinical course to Morbus Dupuytren (MD). We examined whether radiotherapy (RT) can effect symptoms and prevent disease progression.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1996 to December 2001, 25 patients (12 female/13 male) aged 9-76 (median: 56) years had radiotherapy (RT) for symptomatic ML. Follow-up (FU) was at least 1 year. 36 feet (16 right/20 left) were treated, as eleven patients had bilateral disease. Twelve (48%) patients had MD. There were 63 nodules (with 0,5-6,5 cm diameter) on all feet and 20 cords (with 1-4 cm length) on 13 (52%) feet prior to RT. 21 (84%) patients had one or more signs: 14 (56%) severe local pain, eight (32%) walking difficulties, twelve (48%) other symptoms, pressure or tension sensation. The RT field involved all nodules and cords plus safety margin. Two RT-series were applied (each 5 3 Gy in 1 week) separated by 8-12 weeks up to a total dose of 30 Gy. Evaluation was performed at the end of RT, after 3 and 12 months FU and in December 2002. The primary endpoint was prevention of disease progression and avoidance of surgery. Secondary endpoints were objective changes of morphological and functional parameters and patient's satisfaction measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS).RESULTS: With a median FU of 38 (12-67) months no patient experienced progression or underwent surgery: 11 of 36 (44%) feet had a reduced number (overall: -16) or size of nodules, 7 of 13 (54%) feet had a reduced number (overall: -9) or length of cords; gait was improved in six of twelve (50%) feet; pain was reduced or had completely disappeared in 9 of 15 (60%) feet, and other symptoms disappeared in 8 of 18 (44%) symptomatic feet. 20 (80%) patients regarded 28 of 36 (78%) treated feet as improved and 8 (22%) in stable condition. The median relative improvement stated by patients on the VAS was 50% (0-100%). Treatment side effects were minimal: During and within 3 months of the RT course only a slight erythema (CTC 1 degrees ) was seen in five treated lesions, while dry skin changes within the RT portal were observed in three cases (11%) in long term FU (&gt; 12 months).CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating ML and may prevent otherwise necessary surgical interventions. Nodules, cords and symptoms regress, but long-term outcome of at least 5 years has to be awaited. Prospective phase III studies should confirm these results.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],14652674,2003
Responsiveness of Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone.,"PURPOSE: We recently showed that androgen receptors are expressed in Dupuytren's contracture. The aim of the present work was to test the responsiveness of Dupuytren's fibroblasts to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT), the active form of testosterone.RESULTS: Cultured palmar fascia cells from 10 patients with Dupuytren's contracture and 4 normal subjects were exposed to 5 alpha-DHT (10 or 100 ng/mL) for 1, 3, 7, and 15 days. Their phenotype was analyzed immunohistochemically for alpha-smooth muscle actin and androgen receptor expression and proliferation rates were studied.RESULTS: At 15 days the higher concentration of 5 alpha-DHT induced an increase in Dupuytren's fibroblast proliferation, whereas anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin exhibited the strongest expression. At the same time point androgen receptor expression decreased with the lower concentration and disappeared altogether with the higher dose of 5 alpha-DHT.CONCLUSIONS: The palmar fascia is a target tissue for androgen action via androgen receptors. Further studies are required to determine whether control of androgen receptor may control the evolution of Dupuytren's disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,14642522,2003
Activation markers of connective tissue in Dupuytren's contracture: relation to postoperative outcome.,"We investigated 103 consecutive patients operated on for Dupuytren's contracture (DC) to find out the relation between the expression of activation markers of connective tissue in surgical specimens obtained prospectively and recurrence of disease. The history of the disease and present state of the operated hand were obtained a mean of 4 years (range 2.5-6) after the latest operation. Immunohistochemical staining for anticollagen type IV, integrin alpha5, laminin, smooth muscle beta-actin, procollagen type I, and desmin was evaluated. Almost half of the patients noticed recurrences during the study period, one fifth within six months of operation. No differences in the expression of any of the markers investigated were found, either earlier or later than six months postoperatively, in patients with or without recurrent bending. Furthermore, there were no associations between sex, age at onset, number of operations, heredity, diabetes mellitus, or drugs taken for cardiovascular disease, and the expression of any of the immunohistochemical markers. The individual characteristics that place a person at high risk are not obviously related to ongoing production of connective tissue at the time of operation or to connective tissue activity in its conventionally-used sense.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,14649687,2003
[Induratio penis plastica].,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the benefit of radiotherapy with fast electrons in induratio penis plastica (IPP).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 7 years we treated 58 patients with manifested clinically induratio penis plastica. We applied single dose of 3 Gy 2-3 times weekly and a maximum dose of 24-30 Gy. Follow-up was 2 years and included documentation of subjective discomforts (induration, deviation and painful erection).RESULTS: Induration (27.6%) and deviation (24.1%) of the erected penis are little improved, but in two-third of patients (65%) with painful erection defined relief could be obtained. It could also be shown that patients with short history of symptoms had best chances for a successful treatment. Side effects were not seen.CONCLUSION: In our experience radiotherapy is not suitable for all stages of IPP. Only patients in the early stages of IPP-especially the ones who suffer from painful erection-should be considered suitable for treatment with ionising radiation.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Skin tension in the aetiology of Dupuytren's disease; a prospective trial.,"Tension in the palmar fascia has been proposed as a factor causing Dupuytren's disease. If tension does stimulate the growth of new Dupuytren's tissue, relieving longitudinal tension should reduce the recurrence rate following surgery. Thirty patients with palmar Dupuytren's contracture of a single ray that affected only the metacarpophalangeal joint were divided into two groups. Both groups had a fasciotomy: one group through a transverse incision that was closed directly and the other through a longitudinal incision with Z-plasty closure. Half the patients (seven of 14) who had direct closure had recurrence at 2 years as compared to two of the 13 in the Z-plasty group. The trial was stopped at the interim analysis stage due to the high recurrence rate in the first group. These results are consistent with the tension hypothesis for the aetiology of Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",14599823,2003
Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in sera and tissue of patients with Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by progressive deposition of mature collagen fibers. In other fibrotic diseases affecting organs such as the liver, lung, heart, and skin, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their natural inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), play an important role. In this study, serum concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were determined in 22 patients (five women and 17 men; average age, 67 +/- 11 years) with Dupuytren's disease using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue samples were obtained for standard histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Sera and samples of palmar fascia from 20 patients (13 women and seven men; average age, 60 +/- 15 years) who had undergone hand surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome were used as the control group. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Patients with Dupuytren's contracture presented with a TIMP-1 concentration of 437 +/- 160 ng/ml, a significantly higher TIMP-1 concentration than that seen in the control patients, who had a concentration of 321 +/- 70 ng/ml (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with a proliferative active disease (n = 14) had a significantly higher TIMP-1 concentration (525 +/- 136 ng/ml) than patients (n = 8) with a contracture in the late involutional and residual phase (286 +/- 41 ng/ml; p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the TIMP-2, MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 serum concentrations between patients with palmar fibromatosis and the control group. Patients with Dupuytren's disease had a significantly lower MMP-to-TIMP ratio (1.1 +/- 0.3; p &lt; 0.05) than the control group (1.5 +/- 0.35). Patients with an active palmar fibromatosis presented a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced ratio (1 +/- 0.2) compared with those in later phases (1.4 +/- 0.3). TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 could be detected in tissue of patients with Dupuytren's contracture, with an accumulation in proliferative areas. MMPs could be detected locally in Dupuytren's tissue in a few patients, with less positive staining than for TIMPs. In the control group, there was just little or no staining for TIMPs and MMPs. The data indicate that the physiological balance between MMPs and their natural inhibitors is disturbed in patients with a proliferative active Dupuytren's disease. The decrease in the systemic MMP-to-TIMP ratio can cause increased synthesis and deposition of collagen, leading to palmar fibromatosis.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,14504511,2003
Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy: complications and results.,"Recently French rheumatologists have repopularized fasciotomy using a percutaneous needle technique. This blind approach has been claimed to be plagued by numerous complications. We reviewed the charts of 211 patients treated consecutively on 261 hands and 311 fingers to assess the rate of postoperative complications. The first 100 patients were evaluated with a mean follow up of 3.2 years to assess the rate of recurrences and extension of the disease. In the whole group the mean age was 65 years and delay between onset and treatment was 6 years. Division of the cords were performed only in the palm in 165 cases, in the palm and finger in 111 and purely in the finger in 35. Complications were scarce without infection or tendon injury but one digital nerve was found injured during a second procedure. Postoperative gain was prominent at metacarpophalangeal joint level (79% versus 65% at interphalangeal level). The reoperation rate was 24%. In the group assessed at 3.2 years follow up, the recurrence rate was 58% and disease &quot;activity&quot; 69%. Fifty nine hands need further surgery. The ideal indication for this simple and reliable technique is an elderly patient with a bowing cord and predominant MP contracture.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",12954251,2003
"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-negative antiproteinase 3 syndrome presenting as vasculitis, endocarditis, polyneuropathy and Dupuytren's contracture.","Antiproteinase 3 antibodies (antiPR3) are assumed to be subtypes of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), with a high specificity for active Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis. Thus, antiPR3 positivity in ELISA, together with negativity in indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is a rare finding. A 56-year-old man with Dupuytren's contracture and polyneuropathy was admitted for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Echocardiography, performed because of fever and dyspnea, detected aortic valve endocarditis. Because of severe aortic insufficiency the valve was replaced. Blood cultures and bacteriologic investigations of the explanted valve were negative. AntiPR3 were elevated (123-163 U/ml; normal &lt;6 U/ml), together with negativity in IIF. This case shows that antiPR3 elevation with negative ANCA may be associated with vasculitis, endocarditis, polyneuropathy and Dupuytren's contracture. A causal relationship between the clinical presentation and antiPR3 elevation is likely. In order not to miss such cases of vasculitis, combined screening by IIF and ELISA is recommended in selected cases.",The Journal of heart valve disease,12918859,2003
Inhibition of induction of myofibroblasts by interferon gamma in a human fibroblast cell line.,"Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) has been reported as a possible therapeutic agent for contractile diseases in clinical trials and in vitro studies. It is not yet clear, however, whether IFNgamma simply inhibits myofibroblast generation or downregulates alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) production in myofibroblasts. In this study, we attempted to clarify how IFNgamma acts in the generation of myofibroblasts, and the production of alphaSMA by myofibroblasts, using immunofluorescence staining, cell capture enzyme immunoassay (CC-EIA) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for alphaSMA. We examined whether IFNgamma could block the TGFbeta1-promoted changes in myofibroblasts or the generation of myofibroblasts by TGFbeta1. IFNgamma strongly blocked the generation of myofibroblasts and moderately inhibited the production of alphaSMA in TGFbeta1-promoted myofibrobasts. These findings indicate that IFNgamma may be effective in the early stage of contractile diseases to prevent the progression of contractile lesions.",International immunopharmacology,12890425,2003
Genetic susceptibility to Dupuytren's disease: transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFbetaR) gene polymorphisms and Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign fibroproliferative disease of unknown cause. It is a familial condition that commonly affects Caucasians. Genetic studies have yet to identify the genes involved in DD. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) family members are multifunctional; some play a central role in wound healing and fibrosis. Previous studies have implicated TGFbeta cytokines and receptors in DD. In the light of this evidence, TGFbeta receptors represent candidate susceptibility genes for this condition. In this study, we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGFbeta receptors one, two and three (TGFbetaRI, RII and RIII) with the risk of DD formation. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used for genotyping novel and known TGFbeta receptor polymorphisms. DNA samples from 183 DD patients and 181 controls were examined. There was a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in genotype frequency distributions between cases and controls for TGFbetaRI polymorphisms in the recessive model. However, there were no significant difference in genotype or allele frequency distributions between cases and controls for the TGFbetaRII and TGFbetaRIII SNPs.",British journal of plastic surgery,12873459,2003
Elevated levels of beta-catenin and fibronectin in three-dimensional collagen cultures of Dupuytren's disease cells are regulated by tension in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture or disease (DD) is a fibro-proliferative disease of the hand that results in the development of scar-like, collagen-rich disease cords within specific palmar fascia bands. Although the molecular pathology of DD is unknown, recent evidence suggests that beta-catenin may play a role. In this study, collagen matrix cultures of primary disease fibroblasts show enhanced contraction and isometric tension-dependent changes in beta-catenin and fibronectin levels.METHODS: Western blots of beta-catenin and fibronectin levels were determined for control and disease primary cell cultures grown within stressed- and attached-collagen matrices. Collagen contraction was quantified, and immunocytochemistry analysis of filamentous actin performed.RESULTS: Disease cells exhibited enhanced collagen contraction activity compared to control cells. Alterations in isometric tension of collagen matrices triggered dramatic changes in beta-catenin and fibronectin levels, including a transient increase in beta-catenin levels within disease cells, while fibronectin levels steadily decreased to levels below those seen in normal cell cultures. In contrast, both fibronectin and beta-catenin levels increased in attached collagen-matrix cultures of disease cells, while control cultures showed only increases in fibronectin levels. Immunocytochemistry analysis also revealed extensive filamentous actin networks in disease cells, and enhanced attachment and spreading of disease cell in collagen matrices.CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional collagen matrix cultures of primary disease cell lines are more contractile and express a more extensive filamentous actin network than patient-matched control cultures. The elevated levels of beta-catenin and Fn seen in collagen matrix cultures of disease fibroblasts can be regulated by changes in isometric tension.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,12866952,2003
Dupuytren's disease or Cooper's contracture?: Kenneth Fitzpatrick Russell Memorial Lecture.,"In his position as curator of the Cowlishaw collection of historical medical books in the Library of the College, Kenneth Russell prepared the definitive catalogue of the collection. This catalogue is comprehensive and for almost all entries there is an annotation that demonstrates his meticulous attention to detail and the love of the book collection that he managed to secure for the College. It is from this catalogue that I have chosen two books in particular that bring together two great surgeons of the turn of the 19th century. Although he was a pupil of the great John Hunter, the young Astley Cooper possessed good manners and a gift of oratory of which the Scot, his teacher, was devoid. After his apprenticeship with Henry Cline senior, Cooper came to share the podium with Cline at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals and the two dominated surgical teaching in London for some 22 years, until Cline's retirement in 1811. It was the latter who was first to recognize the true nature of the condition now known as Dupuytren's disease. Later, in 1822, Cooper wrote a detailed description of the contracture of the palmar aponeurosis and recommended fasciotomy as being curative. His book A Treatise on Dislocations and Fractures of the Joints, which contains this description of Dupuytren's contracture, is held in the Cowlishaw Collection. On the other side of the English Channel, M. le Baron Dupuytren repeatedly misquoted Cooper and stated that Cooper believed that the disease was incurable. In his famous lecture given to the staff of the Hôtel Dieu in Paris on 5th December 1931, he admitted to having seen 30 or 40 cases over 20 years of practice. It seems likely that he was not aware of the true cause of the condition before 1831 when he treated his first case. This lecture, along with others, are recorded in his Leçons Orales de Clinique Chirurgicale, a copy of which is also to be found in the Cowlishaw Collection.",ANZ journal of surgery,12864830,2003
Musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with thyroid disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Thyroid dysfunction may cause musculoskeletal symptoms. We have evaluated the prevalence of adhesive capsulitis, Dupuytren's contracture, trigger finger, limited joint mobility and carpal tunnel syndrome in a series of patients with various thyroid diseases and differing levels of function.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Patients with euthyroid (diffuse and/or nodular) goitre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, toxic nodular goitre, toxic diffuse goitre and patients with goitre who had partial thyroidectomy were included in the study (n = 137). Neurological and musculoskeletal examinations were performed after a standardized symptom questionnaire. The prevalence of musculoskeletal problems was analysed with respect to thyroid function and thyroid autoantibody status.MEASUREMENTS: Serum concentrations of free T3, free T4, TSH and thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase antibodies were determined. Serum levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium and phosphate along with erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured to exclude other causes of musculoskeletal complaints.RESULTS: When the study group (n = 137) was divided according to thyroid status, 30.6% (n = 42) were thyrotoxic, 16.8% (n = 23) had subclinical thyrotoxicosis, 28.5% (n = 39) were euthyroid, 7.3% (n = 10) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 16.8% (n = 23) were hypothyroid. Overall, adhesive capsulitis was found in 10.9% (n = 15), Dupuytren's contracture in 8.8% (n = 12), limited joint mobility in 4.4% (n = 6), trigger finger in 2.9% (n = 4) and carpal tunnel syndrome in 9.5% (n = 13) of the patients. The prevalence of adhesive capsulitis was highest in patients with subclinical thyrotoxicosis (17.4%); Dupuytren's contracture, limited joint mobility and carpal tunnel syndrome were commonest in hypothyroid patients (21.7%, 8.7% and 30.4%, respectively). Trigger finger occurred in 10% of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. When these prevalences were analysed with respect to thyroid status, carpal tunnel syndrome was significantly more prevalent in the hypothyroid group (P = 0.004). When thyroperoxidase antibody-positive and -negative patients were compared, adhesive capsulitis negatively (P = 0.03, r =-0.18) and trigger finger positively correlated with (P = 0.03, r = 0.21) thyroperoxidase antibody existence.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that musculoskeletal disorders often accompany thyroid dysfunction. In addition to the well-known observation that these disorders are common in patients with hypothyroidism, they are also observed in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Patients with thyroid dysfunction should be questioned for musculoskeletal complaints and referred to a specialist if necessary.",Clinical endocrinology,12864792,2003
The different characteristics of Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts derived from either nodule or cord: expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and the response to stimulation by TGF-beta1.,"Mechanisms behind the onset and progression of Dupuytren's disease are poorly understood. Both myofibroblasts and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta(1)) have been implicated. We studied fibroblast cultures derived from nodules or cords of Dupuytren's contracture tissue to determine the proportion of myofibroblasts present in comparison with flexor retinaculum fibroblast cultures. We identified myofibroblasts by immunohistochemical staining for alpha-SMA. We then investigated the effects of TGF-beta(1) stimulation on these fibroblasts. Basal myofibroblast/fibroblast proportions were 9.7% in nodule cell cultures, 2.7% in cord cell cultures and only 1.3% in flexor retinaculum cell cultures. Nodule and cord myofibroblast proportions increased to 25.4% and 24.2%, respectively, in response to TGF-beta(1) treatment. Flexor retinaculum cell cultures showed no response to TGF-beta(1) stimulation. Fibroblasts cultured from specific regions of Dupuytren's tissue retain myofibroblast features in culture. TGF-beta(1) stimulation causes an increased myofibroblast phenotype to similar levels in both nodule and cord, suggesting that previously quiescent cord fibroblasts can be reactivated to become myofibroblasts by TGF-beta(1). This could be an underlying reason for high recurrence rates seen after surgery or progression following injury.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",12849947,2003
Beta-catenin expression in Dupuytren's disease: potential role for cell-matrix interactions in modulating beta-catenin levels in vivo and in vitro.,"Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a superficial fibromatosis of the hand. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this disease are unknown, recent studies suggest that beta-catenin may be a key factor involved in fibromatosis. In this study, we analysed the in vivo and in vitro expression levels of beta-catenin in DD, using surgical specimens and primary cell lines. Although no somatic mutations (exon 3) of beta-catenin were detected, Western blot analysis revealed high levels of beta-catenin in diseased palmar fascia, and low to undetectable levels of beta-catenin in patient-matched normal palmar fascia. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed high levels of beta-catenin expression within the disease fascia, as well as cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulations of the protein. Immunoprecipitation of beta-catenin from seven patient lesions showed the protein to be tyrosine phosphorylated. Lastly, Western analysis of three patient-matched (disease and normal fascia) primary cell cultures showed significantly elevated levels of beta-catenin in disease cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen lattices. This is the first extensive in vivo and in vitro characterization of beta-catenin in DD, and the first to suggest that the extracellular matrix may play an important role in modulating beta-catenin stability in DD.",Oncogene,12802275,2003
Genetic susceptibility to dupuytren disease: association of Zf9 transcription factor gene.,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a key fibrogenic cytokine that has been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren disease. Zf9 is a transcription factor that increases TGF-beta 1 expression in tissue. The authors previously demonstrated a lack of association between common TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 polymorphisms and Dupuytren disease. Therefore, Zf9 transcription factor represents an additional candidate susceptibility gene for investigating hereditary predisposition to Dupuytren disease. Dupuytren disease, or Dupuytren contracture, is a progressive and recurrent fibroproliferative disease of unknown etiology that affects the human hands. It is often a familial disorder affecting Northern European Caucasians. Genes implicated in the development of Dupuytren disease have not yet been found. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment polymorphism method, the authors genotyped a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the Zf9 gene. A case-control association study of 138 patients with Dupuytren disease versus 255 controls demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls for Zf9 gene polymorphism. Presence of the G allele versus the A allele is associated with an increased risk of developing Dupuytren disease (odds ratio, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.9). The authors believe this to be the first report of a positive genetic association study in Dupuytren disease using single nucleotide polymorphisms.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,12794452,2003
Microarray gene analysis and expression profiles of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's disease, although not altogether uncommon, has eluded scientists who have sought to explain the cause of this palmar fibroproliferative disorder. It can lead to severe limitations of hand function if left untreated. This study is the first broad genetic survey using microarray technology to find gene products that are overexpressed or underexpressed in diseased tissues. The authors found 23 genes with levels that differ consistently from control levels. Nine were selected for further verification using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These genes hold potential promise in explaining some of the demographic trends seen with disease, such as correlation with alcoholism and the striking predisposition for the male gender.",Annals of plastic surgery,12783014,2003

Regulation of expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin in cells of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Our aims were to describe the distribution of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-containing cells in Dupuytren's tissue in vivo and to determine the effects of selected agents in regulating the expression of SMA in Dupuytren's cells in vitro. In selected hypercellular zones of Dupuytren's nodules up to 40% of the cells contained SMA, as shown by immunohistochemistry. A lower percentage (20%) of SMA-containing cells was found in regions of lower cellularity. A notable finding was that treatment in vitro of Dupuytren's cells with platelet-derived growth factor significantly reduced the content of SMA. Cells from the same patients showed a significant increase in expression of SMA in response to treatment with transforming growth factor, which confirmed recent findings. In addition, interferon-gamma, which has been previously used as a treatment for Dupuytren's disease in a clinical study, had no reproducible effect on the expression of this actin isoform. Our findings are of significance for the conservative management of contractures.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume,12729127,2003

Vasoprotective VEGF as a candidate for prevention of recurrence of fibrotic diseases such as Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a disease caused by the proliferation of contractile, fibroblastic cells adjacent to the palmar fascia of the hand. Cellular proliferation is apparently related to similar 'fibroblast' proliferation in wound healing, but continues in the absence of wounding. I propose that this is a similar processes to that which happens in the vascular wall during vascular surgery, that the myofibroblasts are at least partially similar to smooth muscle cells in phenotype, and consequently that treatment with VEGF, either as protein or via gene therapy, which has proven successful in controlling aberrant, wounding-related cell proliferation in arterial grafting, may be valuable in preventing recurrence of Dupuytren's disease after surgery.",Medical hypotheses,12699705,2003
Cytokine manipulation of explanted Dupuytren's affected human palmar fascia.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease plagues human hands and digits producing fibrotic nodules and fascial cords with resultant debilitating flexion contracture deformities. Interest in this condition is great but because the disease is specific to humans and study has been hampered by the lack of an in vivo model. By utilizing an in vivo &quot;nude&quot; rat model it is possible to maintain and study explanted Dupuytren's contracted palmar fascia for prolonged periods of time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human specimens were divided into four, one for in vitro analysis, and three for model explantation. The explanted tissue was perfused with either transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFbeta2), its antibody, or a control vehicle. Explant biopsies were obtained at 30 and 60 days and compared to tissue prior to explantation. Immunohistochemistry of collagen I and III, DNA synthesis, protein production, and fibroblast kinetics were serially determined.RESULTS: Perfusion of explanted Dupuytren's tissue by TGFbeta2 upregulated collagen I and III from biopsies obtained from the explants at 30 days when compared to vehicle control (P &lt; 0.001). Perfusion with antibody prevented this upregulation when compared to vehicle control (P &lt; 0.001). Cell cultures derived from fibroblasts obtained from biopsies of the explants perfused with TGFbeta2 increased DNA synthesis, protein production and fibroblast kinetics.CONCLUSION: These findings paralleled those from other fibroproliferative disorders suggesting a role for TGFbeta2 in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture as well as possible novel treatment approaches.",International journal of surgical investigation,12678125,2003
[Long-term results of the palmar arthrolysis of the proximal interphalangeal joint].,"BACKGROUND: Palmar arthrolysis of the proximal interphalangeal joint is seldom carried out as an isolated treatment of contractures. The operation is usually performed in connection with treatment for a primary illness. Although intra-operative extension of the interphalangeal joint is normally completely achieved, the postoperative results show deficiencies in the extension. METHODS AND CLINICAL MATERIAL: The long-term results of 110 arthrolyses of the proximal interphalangeal joint of 102 patients are presented. The operations were performed on average 4.6 years ago. The analysis was made with standard questionnaires and self-made drawings along the side of the patients' maximally extended finger.RESULTS: &quot;Successful operations&quot; where performed on 76% of all released joints. The angle of the contracture was reduced by at least 10 degrees in these joints. The long-term results were compared in conjunction with results of injuries or operations of other illnesses: M. Dupuytren (primary), relapses of M. Dupuytren, lesions of the flexor tendons, camptodactyly, results of injuries due to the consequences of operations or other illnesses. The results in the group of lesions of the flexor tendons were on the whole unsuccessful.CONCLUSION: Even though thorough postoperative hand therapy(physiotherapy and use of splints) and above-average co-operation of the patients are prerequisites for a successful arthrolysis, it can be seen that the elimination of the underlying illness is of primary importance.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",12601600,2003
Intramuscular tenotomy of flexor digitorum superficialis in the distal forearm after surgical excision of dupuytren's disease.,"Contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint after surgery to excise Dupuytren's disease, despite release of the contributory structures within the finger, can be caused by flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) contracture. We describe five cases where FDS contracture was released by intramuscular tenotomy in the distal forearm. Standard postoperative therapy for Dupuytren's fasciectomy was used and clinical review showed improved finger extension with no loss of strength. We suggest that intramuscular tenotomy of FDS in the forearm can be used safely where indicated after excision of the Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",12531666,2003
Dupuytren'S disease affecting the thumb and first web of the hand.,"The clinical distribution of the Dupuytren's disease cords in the thumb and first web was examined in 100 consecutive patients with Dupuytren's disease. The precise anatomical relations of the cords were then studied in 25 patients undergoing Dupuytren's surgery for thumb and first web space disease. Thumb and first web space involvement was found in 28% of hands affected by Dupuytren's disease, and was the third most common site after the ring and little fingers. Operative findings showed that two major cords could be distinguished. One lying in the first web space and passing towards the insertion of the first dorsal interosseous muscle on the radial side of the index finger and the other lying on the radial aspect of the thumb.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",12531665,2003
[Fibronectin-chemotaxis and collagen-gel contraction of the palmar aponeurosis in morbus dupuytren].,"Causes for Morbus Dupuytren (MD) on the cellular level are largely unknown. We have studied chemotaxis and collagen-gel contraction of cultivated cells from nodules and cords of Morbus Dupuytren patients and normal palmar aponeurosis. The cells of the seized tissue showed an increased chemotaxis in gradients of the chemo-attractant fibronectin. Furthermore embedded into collagen-gels cells from MD patients especially from the region of cords to the skin had an enhanced ability to contract a three-dimensional collagen network compared to those originating from the center of the nodules and control palmar aponeurosis. One reason for the increase of chemotactic motion and the ability to contract gels could be a surplus of receptors for extracellular matrix proteins (integrins) on the surface of cells from seized tissues. Flow cytometry of cells fluorimetrically stained for beta 1 -, alpha 2 - and alpha 3 -integrins displayed no differences in the quantity of these main cell surface receptors.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",12494380,2002
NA,"The authors report a clinical case of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans in a 65 year old diabetic woman. The characteristic cutaneous lesion restricted to the dorsal aspect of the left hand has been evolved since two years, together with a progressive development of a typical Dupuytren disease. This yielded a contracture of the last 3 phalanges of the same left hand. Confirmatory techniques included the histology of the skin, the reactivity of specific-IgG antibodies showing high avidity and Western blot. Of this, the immunodominant antigens which were extracted from 3 genospecies of Borrelia sensu lato i.e. Bb sensu stricto, Bb garinii, Bb afzelii were compatible with past infection. Apart from the diabetic status which may have predisposed the patient to the development of Dupuytren disease, the authors question about the potential role of Borrelia burgdorferi in the occurrence of this associated disease.",Acta clinica Belgica,12462799,2002
A clinical report of the effect of mechanical stress on functional results after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Early postoperative treatment after Dupuytren's fasciectomy traditionally has included the application of mechanical stress to digital extension with splints and exercise. This study examines the effect of mechanical stress, which may compromise nutrient delivery to the tissues, on inflammation, flare, hypertrophic scar, digital range of motion (ROM), and therapy visits. The authors compared functional outcomes in operated digits treated postoperatively with tension applied (TA) and no tension applied (NTA), retrospectively from 1983 to 1993 (TA only) and prospectively from 1993 to 1999 (TA and NTA). The charts of 268 patients who underwent Dupuytren's fasciectomy were reviewed and divided into 2 groups (TA and NTA). Each case was analyzed with respect to age, sex, number of digits operated, postoperative management technique, therapy visits, metacarpophalangeal joint and proximal interphalangeal joint ROM, degree of flare, and scar. There were significant differences in ROM, scar formation, flare, and treatment time in favor of the NTA technique. The results indicate that postoperative management that prevents applied mechanical tension in the early phases of wound healing decreases complications after this surgery and that no digital motion is lost to extension with the NTA technique.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,12449347,2002
The bacterial colonisation of silicone oil used in the management of wounds of the hands--a source of nosocomial infection?,"For 30 years, silicone oil has been used for the management and rehabilitation of the injured hand. Its benefits accrue from its providing a non-irritant, bland, air-free medium in which the hand can undergo early movement, which prevents drying out of the tissues and helps in the separation of necrotic and infected tissue. It has been reported, however, that the silicone oil might act as a reservoir for nosocomial infection after two patients developed epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) infections. Since no firm guidelines exist with regard to open and/or infected wounds and the continued use of the same oil, a prospective study was set up to study the bacterial colonisation of the silicone oil. Thirty-five consecutive patients were entered into the study. The oil for each patient was changed each week but if any wound became clinically infected the oil was changed earlier. Treatment was continued until the wound was healed or until the treatment was stopped by the referring doctor. Bacteriology swabs taken from the wound and the oil before each treatment and from the oil after each treatment were analysed for bacterial colonisation. The results indicated that while bacteria were transferred into the oil from the wound, the inoculum was small and had no effect on wound healing. There was no evidence that wounds were being re-infected from the oil. The conclusion was that silicone oil remains a safe medium in which to exercise injured hands.",Hand surgery : an international journal devoted to hand and upper limb surgery and related research : journal of the Asia-Pacific Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand,12365046,2002
Collagen as a clinical target: nonoperative treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"The cellular events leading to abnormal synthesis of collagen are important to our understanding of pathologic processes leading to impaired joint function. The contracture of Dupuytren's disease is a notable example. In a series of controlled phase-2 clinical trials, excessive collagen deposition in Dupuytren's disease has been targeted by a unique nonoperative method using enzyme (Clostridial collagenase) injection therapy to lyse and rupture finger cords causing metacarpophalangeal and/or proximal interphalangeal joint contractures. Forty-nine patients were treated in a random, placebo-controlled trial of one dose of collagenase versus placebo at one center. Subsequently 80 patients were treated in a random, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of collagenase at 2 test centers. The results of these studies indicate that nonoperative collagenase injection therapy for Dupuytren's disease is both a safe and effective method of treating this disorder in the majority of patients as an alternative to surgical fasciectomy. Phase-3 efficacy trials are now being planned to further develop and test this method under Food and Drug Administration regulatory guidelines. The findings of our study may lead to simpler and less invasive nonoperative treatments of joint limitation in which collagen plays a major pathologic role.",The Journal of hand surgery,12239666,2002
Functional benefit of Dupuytren's surgery.,"The results of surgery for Dupuytren's disease were prospectively assessed to see if there is a correlation between hand function, the degree of deformity and the post-operative result. A total of 42 patients were followed-up for 6 months. The mean flexion deformity was 81 degrees pre-operatively and 32 degrees post-operatively. The mean Sollerman score improved from 71 (out of 80) pre-operatively to 77 post-operatively. There was a significant correlation between the degree of deformity and the Sollerman score, and also between the improvement in deformity after surgery, and the Sollerman score. We conclude that hand function is worsened by increasing deformity in Dupuytren's disease and improved by correction of the deformity.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",12162983,2002
[Pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture--a review].,"Dupuytren's disease is a palmar fibromatosis bringing about irreversible finger contracture. Histopathologically, the disease is characterized by the presence of the two types of structures: nodules, containing of intensively proliferating cells, and fibrous cords, formed by thick bundles of collagen fibers. It seems that key role in the development of Dupuytren's contracture play alterations of palmar fibroblasts activity. These cells begin intensively proliferate and transform to myofibroblasts. The later ones sharing phenotypic features of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells take part in remodelling of extracellular matrix and are a source of palmar contracture. The pivotal factors involved in changes of palmar fibroblasts functions seem to be growth factors (mainly TGF beta, PDGF and bFGF). However, the participation of reactive forms of oxygen in mentioned process is also considered.",Chirurgia narzadow ruchu i ortopedia polska,12087679,2002
Dupuytren's disease: physiologic changes in nodule and cord fibroblasts through aging in vitro.,"The pathogenesis of the fibrotic disease Dupuytren's contracture remains unclear. The disease process includes two structurally distinct fibrotic elements, the nodule and the cord. It has been proposed that as the disease progresses, nodules develop into cords. To corroborate that hypothesis, the authors took advantage of cultured fibroblast differences found between gap junction intercellular communication and fibroblast-populated collagen lattice contraction. Paired fibroblast cell lines of nodules and cords derived from four patients with Dupuytren's disease were maintained in culture for at least eight passages. The presence of gap junction intercellular communication in nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts was documented and reported as a coupling index. The contraction of free-floating nodule- or cord-derived collagen lattices was also documented and reported. Early passage (passage 4) cord-derived fibroblasts showed a significant increase in coupling index compared with passage 4 nodule-derived fibroblasts (4.0 +/- 0.4 versus 2.5 +/- 0.3, respectively), where p &lt; or = 0.01. However, late passage (passage 8) nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts were equivalent in their coupling index (4.1 +/- 0.4 versus 4.4 +/- 0.4, respectively). Early passage nodule-derived fibroblast-populated collagen lattices contracted by 64 percent, whereas late passage nodule-derived lattices showed less contraction, at only 40 percent. Early and late passage cord-derived lattices contracted 46 and 37 percent, respectively. All nodule- and cord-derived cell lines were statistically equivalent at lattice contraction by passage 8. These in vitro studies support the hypothesis that fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's contracture nodules change their phenotype after undergoing repeated cell passage, acquiring a cord-like fibroblast phenotype. Dupuytren's nodules represent the early, active form of fibrosis in which cells are more proliferative, better at fibroblast-populated collagen lattice contraction, and display less gap junction intercellular communication. The speculation is that alterations in gap junction intercellular communication may be involved in the progression of Dupuytren's nodules to cords as the disease progresses.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,12087251,2002
The effect of steroids on Dupuytren's disease: role of programmed cell death.,This study compared the rates of proliferation and apoptosis of cells within nodules of Dupuytren's disease and nodules from patients that had been injected preoperatively with steroid (Depo-Medrone). It also compared the effects of steroids in apoptosis in cultured Dupuytren's cells and control fibroblasts from palmar fascia and fascia lata. Steroids reduced the rate of fibroblast proliferation and increased the rate of apoptosis of both fibroblasts and inflammatory cells in Dupuytren's tissue. Steroids also produced apoptosis of cultured Dupuytren's cells but not of palmar fascia and fascia lata cells.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",12074617,2002
[Severe contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease: does capsuloligamentous release improve outcome?].,"Purpose. Evaluation of effectiveness of capsuloligamentous release in severe PIP joint contractures in Dupuytren's disease. Method. Prospective study to compare the clinical outcome of eleven patients with severe contracture of the PIP joint due to Dupuytren's disease, in whom an additional capsulotomy was performed to reduce a residual flexion contracture of the PIP joint of 20 degree and more after release and excision of all diseased fascia, with the outcome of 32 patients with severe contracture of the PIP joint due to Dupuytren's disease, in whom the PIP joint contracture could be reduced by fasciectomy alone. Preoperatively all patients had a severe flexion contracture (60 degrees or greater) of one PIP joint. All patients underwent standardized operative treatment and postoperative extension splinting program for six months. Follow-up examinations included assessment of active range of motion at two, four, ten, 16 and 24 weeks after surgery. Results. In the noncapsulotomy group, preoperative contracture averaged 70.6 degrees and intraoperative residual contracture averaged 2 degrees. In the capsulotomy group, preoperative contracture averaged 78.6 degrees. Intraoperative residual contracture averaged 61.8 degrees before and 2 degrees after capsulotomy. At the final follow-up examination, PIP joint flexion contracture averaged 15 degrees in the noncapsulotomy group compared to 16 degrees in the capsulotomy group. Conclusion. Residual flexion contracture of a PIP joint after release and excision of all diseased fascia in Dupuytren's disease can be reduced by capsuloligamentous release. The data of this study showed no significant differences in the outcome at the final follow-up examination between patients with and without capsulotomy. Therefore, we recommend capsulotomy as treatment of residual flexion contracture of the PIP joint in Dupuytren's disease.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",12073190,2002
[Preoperative Intermittent Pneumatic Soft-Tissue Distraction in Patients with severe Dupuytren's Contracture].,"PURPOSE: Evaluation of the outcome of preoperative intermittent pneumatic soft tissue distraction (IPD) in patients with severe contractures in Dupuytren's disease with special regards on recurrent deformities.METHOD: In a prospective study, nine patients with Dupuytren's contracture grade III and IV according to the classification of Tubiana were treated with a preoperative intermittent soft-tissue distraction using a pneumatic extension device followed by a standardized operative correction and follow-up program. Sixteen fingers were involved: grade I and II four fingers, grade III and IV twelve fingers. Nine fingers - grade III and IV seven fingers - in six patients had a recurrent deformity.RESULTS: The preoperative reduction of contracture simplifies the surgical treatment. Preoperatively using the IPD, the flexion contracture was reduced between 5 and 60 degrees. With an average of 29 (10 to 60) degrees, the improvement was greater in fingers with severe contracture (grade III and IV according to Tubiana) than in fingers with a minor contracture averaging 10 (5 to 25) degrees. In fingers with recurrent deformity, the reduction of the flexion contracture averaged 27 (5 to 60) degrees. There were no complications leading to break off of the distraction.CONCLUSION: The intermittent pneumatic distraction is a good alternative to the method introduced by Messina for preoperative soft-tissue distraction in patients with severe Dupuytren's contracture.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",12073189,2002

On the origin and spread of Dupuytren's disease.,"The first author to suggest an origin and spread of Dupuytren's disease was Early who wrote in 1962, &quot;If one postulates the condition as having arisen in one particular racial group (the Nordic for example) then the variable distribution in other parts of the world might be explained on the basis of migration from that group.&quot; Dupuytren's disease is currently called a Viking disease on the assumption that the disease was spread to Europe and the British Isles during the Viking Age of the 9th to the 13th centuries. From a literature search, it is proposed that Dupuytren's disease existed in Europe earlier than the Viking Age and originated much earlier in prehistory.",The Journal of hand surgery,12015711,2002
Bone spurs: mechanism of production of different shapes based on observations in Dupuytren's diathesis.,"Bone spur formation on the shaft of the middle phalanx of the little finger was an incidental finding during surgical treatment of five cases of Dupuytren's contracture. The presence of such spurs in Dupuytren's contracture is not adequately explained in the literature. In areas of high tensile stress, such as the attachments of fascia and fibrous cords, bone remodels to reduce stress concentration and to make the stress transfer from one tissue to the other as smooth as possible. It cannot be regarded as the same process that is seen in heterotopic calcification in other sites in the body, and should be regarded instead as a physiological bone response to tensile stresses rather than a change intimately coupled with Dupuytren's disease.",ANZ journal of surgery,11982519,2002
Genetic susceptibility in Dupuytren's disease. TGF-beta1 polymorphisms and Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibroproliferative disease of unknown aetiology. It is often familial and commonly affects Northern European Caucasian men, but genetic studies have yet to identify the relevant genes. Transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-beta1) is a multifunctional cytokine which plays a central role in wound healing and fibrosis. It stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix. Previous studies have implicated TGF-beta1 in Dupuytren's disease, suggesting that it may represent a candidate susceptibility gene for this condition. We have investigated the association of four common single nucleotide polymorphisms in TGF-beta1 with the risk of developing Dupuytren's disease. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used for genotyping TGF-beta1 polymorphisms. DNA samples from 135 patients with Dupuytren's disease and 200 control subjects were examined. There was no statistically significant difference in TGF-beta1 genotype or allele frequency distributions between the patients and controls for the codons 10, 25, -509 and -800 polymorphisms. Our observations suggest that common TGF-beta1 polymorphisms are not associated with a risk of developing Dupuytren's disease. These data should be interpreted with caution since the lack of association was shown in only one series of patients with only known, common polymorphisms of TGF-beta1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case-control association study in Dupuytren's disease using single nucleotide polymorphisms in TGF-beta1.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Tamoxifen decreases fibroblast function and downregulates TGF(beta2) in dupuytren's affected palmar fascia.,"BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder that is associated with increased collagen deposition. Isoforms of transforming growth factor beta (TGF(beta)), normally TGF(beta1) and TGF(beta2), are involved in the progressive fibrosis of Dupuytren's disease. It has been suggested that downregulation of TGF(beta) may be useful in the treatment of the condition. Tamoxifen, a synthetic nonsteroidal antiestrogen, is known to modulate the production of TGF(beta). This study examined the role of tamoxifen in decreasing fibroblast function and downregulating TGF(beta2).METHODS: Primary cultures of fibroblasts were obtained from Dupuytren's affected fascia and carpal tunnel affected fascia as a control. Collagen lattices were prepared and populated with the fibroblasts. The fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCL) were then measured for contraction every 24 h for 5 days. Supernatant was obtained from the culture medium following completion of the FPCL portion of the experiment and used for a TGF(beta2) immunoassay.RESULTS: Dupuytren's affected fibroblasts contracted the FPCLs significantly more than carpal tunnel control fibroblasts. Treating the fibroblasts with tamoxifen caused a decreased contraction rate in both Dupuytren's affected fibroblasts and carpal tunnel controls. There was increased TGF(beta2) expression in the Dupuytren's affected fascia group compared to the carpal tunnel control group. Tamoxifen decreased TGF(beta2) expression in Dupuytren's affected fascia group but not in the carpal tunnel control group.CONCLUSION: TGF(beta) appears to be the key cytokine in the fibrogenic nature of Dupuytren's disease. Tamoxifen treatment has been demonstrated to decrease the function of fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's affected fascia and downregulated TGF(beta2) production in these same fibroblasts. These data suggest a method to manipulate and control Dupuytren's contracture in the clinical setting.",The Journal of surgical research,11922728,2002
Dupuytren's disease in children-differential diagnosis.,"PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease in children is uncommon; only a few histologically confirmed diagnoses are found in literature. In its early, proliferative phase with many fibroblasts, it can resemble the early stadium of an epitheloid sarcoma, which also is a rare tumor. The purpose of this report is to show pediatric surgeons and pathologists the importance of differential diagnosis of nodules and fibrotic bands in children's hands, especially to exclude a malignancy.METHODS: Between 1998 and 2000, 3 children at ages of 2(1/2) years, 9 years, and 10 years, respectively, presented with the clinical signs of Dupuytren's disease of the hand. Each of them had fibrous bands with a flexion contracture of the fingers. All of them underwent fasciectomy.RESULTS: In patient 1, a 10 degrees extension lag of the index finger resulted after 3 operations. Histology findings showed the typical features of Dupuytren's disease. In patient 2, histology findings showed a recurring digital fibroma of childhood. After consultation with the pathologist and reevaluation of the slides, the histologic diagnosis was corrected to Dupuytren's disease. Full extension and thumb abduction has been achieved. In patient 3, histology of the first and second operation was misdiagnosed as Dupuytren's disease. In the third operation 2(1/2) years later, the histologic diagnosis of epitheloid sarcoma was made. Amputation of the forearm was necessary.CONCLUSIONS: Exact anamnesis, location of the lesion, and suspicious diagnosis must be mentioned to the pathologist in the case of biopsy or excision of Dupuytrenlike lesions in children's hands. Awareness of the possibility of the epitheloid sarcoma may help prevent misdiagnosis.",Journal of pediatric surgery,11912542,2002
Dupuytren's disease of the wrist.,"The authors present the case of a 47-year-old female who presents with bilateral Dupuytren's disease of the wrist. To date, three English language papers reporting on the occurrence of Dupuytren's disease at the wrist have been presented. These reports represent cases in males with unilateral involvement of their wrists where there has been primary Dupuytren's disease of the palm apparently spreading to the wrist in continuity. Our case demonstrates isolated bilateral Dupuytren's disease of the wrist in a female. The authors feel that this clinical presentation is rare and that consideration should be given to the diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease when there is a painful lesion of the soft tissues adjacent to the wrist. The presence of bilateral lesions at the wrist should further heighten the suspicion of Dupuytren's disease even in the absence of associated disease in the palm or fingers.

Dupuytren's cord involving the septa of Legueu and Juvara: a case report.,"A patient with Dupuytren's disease with involvement of the palmar fascial complex and digital contracture is described. A vertical cord had developed in the transverse ligament of the palmar aponeurosis fibers and the underlying septa of Legueu and Juvara. The cord was composed of a pretendinous band, transverse ligament of the palmar aponeurosis, and septum of Legueu and Juvara. The cord was attached deeply in the soft tissue confluence of the sagittal band, palmar plate, and interpalmar plate ligament. Involvement of the transverse ligament of the palmar aponeurosis and septa of Legueu and Juvara in Dupuytren's disease is rare. Understanding of the normal and pathologic fascial anatomy explains their simultaneous involvement and is necessary for complete ablation of the diseased tissue.",The Journal of hand surgery,11901396,2002

Dupuytren's contracture and sarcoma.,"In order to study possible connections between Dupuytren's contracture and sarcoma we analysed the records of 18 patients who developed sarcoma 5 years or more after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. We found an increased frequency of fibrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, but these patients did not differ from the other patients in the study group. Our analysis suggests that neither smoking, diabetes nor cancer syndromes can explain why patients with Dupuytren's contracture have a higher incidence of sarcoma.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",11895346,2002

Androgen receptors in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Palmar fascia tissue and cultured cells from patients with Dupuytren's contracture and from normal subjects were characterized and analyzed for androgen receptor expression. Androgen receptors have never been studied in Dupuytren's myofibroblasts and may have a role in its high male predominance. Surgical samples were collected from eight patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture and from four patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, used as control tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tissue samples and on cell cultures with anti-androgen receptor, anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin, anti-fibronectin, and anti-type I and III collagen antibodies using the biotin avidin peroxidase method as revelatory system. Immunostaining for androgen receptors in tissue samples and cultured cells revealed nuclear reaction in many Dupuytren's myofibroblasts, but in few fibroblasts of the normal palmar fascia. In a double-labeling study, androgen receptors were seen to co-localize with alpha-actin in both cell cultures and tissue samples. We present the first evidence that the palmar fascia is a target tissue for androgen action and that the expression of androgen receptors in Dupuytren's contracture is considerably higher than in the normal palmar fascia. Further studies will need to evaluate whether the androgen-responsive state of the tissue is related to the high incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in the male sex.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,11853085,2002
The prevalence of Dupuytren's disease among 2 different ethnic groups in northern Norway.,"Dupuytren's disease is common in Norway and northern Europe but rare in individuals who are not of European descent. The aboriginal Sami of the northernmost parts of Scandinavia are ethnically distinct from most Norwegians. The occurrence of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown among the Sami. Data were collected on 456 individuals older than 50 years who were living in an area 750 km north of the arctic circle. Dupuytren's disease was found in 31 men and 3 women. The prevalence was lower among Sami than Norwegian men of all ages. The prevalence of having a grandson with Dupuytren's disease was also lower among Sami than Norwegian grandparents. Although none of the differences reached statistical significance, the results show that the prevalence is not very low among Sami men but probably lower than among ethnic Norwegians living in the same area, confirming the importance of a genetic disposition to the disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,11810624,2002

Based on the clinical evaluation the participants were classified into three groups: (1) those with no signs of Dupuytren's disease were referred to as the reference cohort; (2) those with palpable nodules in the palmar fascia were classified as having stage 1; and (3) those who had contracted fingers or had been operated on due to contractures were classified as having stage 2 of Dupuytren's disease. In 1997, after a 15- year follow-up period, the mortality rate and causes of death were investigated in relation to the clinical findings from 1981/82. Information about causes of death were obtained from the National Icelandic Death Registry and the Icelandic Cancer Registry. During the follow-up period, 21.5% (225/1048) of the reference cohort were deceased compared to 29.9% (55/184) of those with stage 1 and 47.7% (31/65) of those with stage 2 of Dupuytren's disease. When adjusted for age, smoking habits and other possible confounders, individuals with stage 2 of the disease showed increased total mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4]. Cancer deaths were increased (HR = 1.9; CI 1.0-3.6). In contrast, participants with stage 1 of Dupuytren's disease did not show increased mortality. A moderate but non-significant increase in cancer incidence was observed among individuals with stage 2 of Dupuytren's disease (HR = 1.5; 95% CI 0.9-2.4, P = 0.15). The study showed increased total mortality of individuals with Dupuytren's disease stage 2, where 42% of the excess in mortality could be attributed to cancer deaths.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,11781116,2002
Rheumatological complications associated with the use of indinavir and other protease inhibitors.,"Several cases are reported of rheumatological pathology (temporomandibular dysfunction, frozen shoulder, Dupuytren's disease, and tendinitis) most probably related to the intake of indinavir in HIV positive patients. A survey using an anonymous questionnaire of 878 people with HIV infection treated with antiretroviral drugs suggests that other protease inhibitors may also cause arthralgia.",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,11779768,2002
Bilateral Dupuytren's contracture in a black patient.,"The first case of Dupuytren's contracture in a black patient with no obvious caucasian admixture was reported in 1979. This condition is rare in the purely black population and since 1979 only 23 cases have been reported. We present the case of a black man with no history of caucasian admixture with bilateral Dupuytren's contracture. We suggest that this condition may not be as rare as the literature suggests and, that canvassing other hand societies for their experience, particularly in the continent of Africa, may help to establish the true incidence of this condition.",International journal of clinical practice,11770364,2002

[Radiotherapy of early stage Dupuytren disease. Long-term results after a median follow-up period of 10 years].,"PURPOSE: In early stage Dupuytren's contracture radiotherapy was applied to prevent disease progression. Long-term results and late toxicity of this treatment were evaluated in a retrospective analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1982 and 1994, 99 patients (176 hands) received orthovoltage radiotherapy, which consisted of two courses with 5 x 3 Gy (total dose: 30 Gy, daily fractionated; 120 kV, 4 mm Al), separated by a 6 to 8-week pause. The Dupuytren's contracture was staged according to the classification of Tubiana et al. The long-term outcome was analyzed at last follow-up between July and November 1999. The median follow-up was 10 years (range 7-18 years). Late toxicity was assessed using the LENT-SOMA criteria.RESULTS: In Stage N 84% and Stage N/I 67% of cases remained stable. 65% of the cases in Stage I and 83% in Stage II showed progressive nodules and cords. In case of progression we saw no complications after a second radiotherapy or salvage operation.CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy effectively prevents disease progression for early stage Dupuytren's contracture (Stage N, N/I). Moreover, in case of disease progression despite radiotherapy salvage surgery is still feasible.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],11757183,2002
Emergency microsurgical revascularization for critical ischemia during surgery for Dupuytren's contracture: a case report.,"Injuries to the common digital or proper digital arteries during surgery for Dupuytren's contracture are relatively rare but may be underreported. Delay in recognition and inadequate management may result in prolonged ischemia or gangrene and eventually necessitate finger amputation. A patient who sustained inadvertent injury to several digital arteries during reoperation for recurrent Dupuytren's contracture of the ring and small fingers developed persistent critical ischemia of both fingers. He was transported emergently to a replantation center where the arterial injuries were immediately repaired by microsurgical techniques, resulting in successful salvage of both fingers.",The Journal of hand surgery,11721263,2001
"Dupuytren's disease, alcohol consumption and alcoholism.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between alcohol consumption and Dupuytren's disease.DESIGN: The participants were recruited from a previous study on Dupuytren's disease carried out in 1981-82 as part of a cohort study. Men with Dupuytren's disease in the former study and a control group were invited. The groups were matched for age and smoking habits.SETTINGS: The study took place at the Heart Preventive Clinic in Reykjavik.PATIENTS: Of 244 invited participants, 193 (79.1%) responded to the invitation; 137 had Dupuytren's disease and 56 were disease-free. Participants were examined for the presence of Dupuytren's disease and answered a questionnaire about alcohol habits.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Alcoholism, alcohol consumption and signs of Dupuytren's disease.RESULTS: Of the Dupuytren's group, 19 (13.9%) had been treated for alcoholism or were heavy drinkers compared to 8 (14.3%) of those without Dupuytren's disease (NS). Little or moderate alcohol consumption was reported in 78.1% of the Dupuytren's patients compared to 73.2% of the controls (NS). Total abstainers from alcohol were 11 (8.0%) in the Dupuytren's group compared to 7 (12.5%) in the control group (NS).CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support a positive association between the use of alcohol and Dupuytren's disease.",Scandinavian journal of primary health care,11697563,2001
Differences in alpha smooth muscle actin expression between fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's nodules or cords.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a fibrotic lesion of the palmar fascia that includes two distinct structures, the nodule and the cord. Histologically the Dupuytren's nodule has a high cell density with numerous myofibroblasts (alpha smooth muscle actin-expressing fibroblasts). The Dupuytren's cord has a rich connective tissue matrix containing a low density of elongated spindle-shaped fibroblasts. The cytoskeletal structures of cultured fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's nodules and cords of surgically treated patients were studied and compared. Immunohistology showed no obvious morphological differences between Dupuytren's nodule and cord cultured cells, when focal adhesions (vinculin), intermediate filaments (vimentin), microtubules (alpha tubulin), or microfilaments (filamentous actin) were viewed. However, a greater proportion of nodule cultured cells were positive for alpha smooth muscle actin compared to cord-derived cells. The increased expression in nodule cells of alpha smooth muscle actin was confirmed by Western blot analysis. It appears that fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's nodules or cords retain in vivo cytoskeletal characteristics, when grown in tissue culture.",Experimental and molecular pathology,11599921,2001
Analysis of the vascular anatomy of the palm and its clinical relevance in Morbus Dupuytren.,"The triangular center of the palm is supposedly hypovascularized. Intraoperative clinical studies have shown numerous vessels and nerves rising through the palmar aponeurosis into the skin in this area. To investigate these findings we have dissected 7 cadaver hands in order to analyze the vascular and neural structure of the palm. On an average we have found 30 bundles in the center of the palm. At least half of them were vascular-nerve bundles, the other bundles consisted either of a nerve, an artery or a vein. By means of histological testing we have also found lymphatic vessels accompanying the blood vessels and the nerves. Our study shows a greater number of vessels rising into the skin than has been previously described in the literature, so that we cannot confirm the triangular hypovascular zone in the center of the palm.",Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,11508365,2001
[Isolated fifth digit localization in Dupuytren's disease].,"Isolated fifth digit localisation in Dupuytren's disease has a bad reputation. A series of this injury is reported with a special attention on recurrences. This series is composed of 30 cases in 26 patients (four bilateral cases): the majority of patients were male and 53.5 y was the average age. Extension loss of MP and PIP joints were present in 25 cases, MP isolated extension loss in two cases and PIP in three cases. The treatment performed was a percutaneous needle technique in five cases, surgical fasciectomy in 24 cases using a zigzag palmodigital longitudinal fasciectomy approach in 18 cases, an open palm technique in six cases and one isolated laterodigital flap. Assessment of correction was based on Tubiana's classification. Average follow-up was 22 months. Postoperative course was uneventful except for one case of precarious vascularisation which leads to an amputation. For the digitopalmar localisations: 15 stage 0 or 1, 7 stage 2, 1 stage 3 and 1 stage 4. Improvement percentage was 0.60 in combined cases, 0.65 in cases with a MP loss and 0.46 in PIP loss. Five recurrences were noted. Literature on this topic is coherent with the fact that isolated involvement of the fifth digit carry a bad prognosis, mainly due to the high recurrence rate in our series as in other papers. In severe injuries, an imperfect result should be the aim to prevent vasculonervous complications.",Chirurgie de la main,11496607,2001
[Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy. Complications and results].,"Recently French rheumatologists have repopularized fasciotomy using a percutaneous needle technique. This blind approach has been claimed to be plagued by numerous complications. We reviewed the charts of 211 patients treated consecutively on 261 hands and 311 fingers to assess the rate of postoperative complications. The first 100 patients were evaluated with a mean follow up of 3.2 years to assess the rate of recurrences and extension of the disease. In the whole group the mean age was 65 years and delay between onset and treatment was six years. Rupture of the cords were performed only in the palm in 165 cases, in the palm and finger in 111 and purely at digital level in 35. Complications were scarce without infection or tendon injury but one digital nerve was found injured during the second procedure. Postoperative gain was prominent at metacarpophalangeal joint level (79% versus 65% at interphalangeal level). Reoperation rate was 24%. In the group controlled at 3.2 years follow up, recurrence rate was 58% and disease &quot;activity&quot; 69%. Fifty nine hands need further surgery. The ideal indication for this simple and reliable technique is an elderly patient with a bowing cord and a predominant MP contracture.",Chirurgie de la main,11496606,2001
Langerhans cells in Dupuytren's contracture.,"We have examined biopsies of Dupuytren's contracture palmar fascia, overlying subcutis and skin, and have correlated the distribution of gross macroscopic changes in the hand, mapped pre- and intraoperatively, with light microscopic immunohistochemical findings. We report increased numbers of S100 positive Langerhans cells (an epidermal cell of dendritic lineage) and CD45 positive cells, both in &quot;nodules&quot; and at dermo-epidermal junctions, in the biopsied tissues. This suggests that Langerhans cells migrate from the epidermis into Dupuytren's contracture tissue, possibly in response to local changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines within the tissue. Our findings, together with other reports of increased numbers of dermal dendrocytes and inflammatory cells in Dupuytren's contracture tissue, lend circumstantial support to the &quot;extrinsic theory&quot; of the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture. However, the earliest stages of the disease process have not been defined, and therefore the events which ultimately produce fibrosis in the palmar fascial complex in susceptible individuals could begin in the skin and/or within deeper tissues, especially where there is dysregulation of the immune system.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",11469841,2001

A congenital hand deformity: Dupuytren's disease.,"A 10-month-old child presented with a lack of extension at the distal interphalangeal joint. Despite the absence of trauma, a provisional diagnosis of mallet finger led to treatment using a short dorsal splint. Four months later the flexion had increased and included the proximal interphalangeal joint. Palpation revealed a palmar cord on the lateral aspect of the finger. Surgery disclosed a typical Dupuytren cord and the histology supported this diagnosis. There was no known family history of the disease. There was no sign of recurrence 27 months after surgery in this case of Dupuytren's disease that was present at birth.",The Journal of hand surgery,11418917,2001
[Dupuytren contracture in North Germany. Epidemiological study of 500 cases].,"Dupuytren's disease is the &quot;classical&quot; hand illness of the north: it affects people of Celtic or Viking descent throughout the whole of northern Europe, whereas it is an unknown disease in the Mediterranean region. Dupuytren's contracture appears to be an extremity-related disease. Owing to the unclear etiology and a lack of up-to-date demographic data for northern Germany this study aims--together with the literature--to elucidate the role of associated illnesses in an attempt to discover pathogenic explanations. 566 patients suffering from Dupuytren's disease in the area around Hanover were analysed with respect to epidemiological features and their Tubiana contracture stage. 91.2% were of pure northern German stock, 12.5% had a family predisposition. The male-to-female ratio was 7:1. Men were afflicted on average at the age of 56 years. Intellectuals were scored 3.17, while manual workers scored 4.21. There were pre-existing ipsilateral lesions in 15% of cases. 55.1% had bilateral contracture. Ectopic penile and plantar fibrosis or knuckle pads were found in 6.7% of cases. The distribution of stages I-IV decreased by 2.4% from 59.1% among the 1,808 afflicted finger rays. With a score of 3.7-3.72, drinkers and smokers presented significantly more severe contractures, while the 8.2% of diabetics displayed a milder form. Among the epileptics--all of whom were affected bilaterally--the Tubiana stage of 3.71 exceeded the median manual score of 3.63 for the group as a whole. Thus Dupuytren's disease is a general but not an exclusively extremity-related sickness. The androtropy is pathognomic. Women develop the disease one decade later than men. In old age the male-to-female ratio equalizes. Drinkers, smokers and heavy manual workers present a more severe affliction, while diabetics suffer from a significantly less severe form. Although the ulnar type dominates, the radial type accounts for 14.4% of cases. 1.9 million Germans are chronically ill because of Dupuytren's disease. Despite a trauma history, Dupuytren's disease is not recognized as an occupational disease.",Der Unfallchirurg,11357696,2001
Current aspects of colchicine therapy -- classical indications and new therapeutic uses.,"Colchicine has been traditionally used for the treatment of gout. At present there is no generally accepted alternative to colchicine for the treatment of acute attacks or for the prevention of further attacks. The complex actions of this substance, which are mainly attributable to its stabilising action on the cytoskeleton and cell membranes, and its special pattern of distribution form the basis for the results presented here regarding the prophylactic or therapeutic actions of colchicine in a whole range of other diseases. This is all the more significant in that in several instances it concerns diseases that have so far been unsatisfactorily controlled by other treatments. Because of its astonishing absence of side effects, some authors consider that low dose colchicine may be considered as an alternative to previous therapies or even a means of first choice. It is therefore incorrect to think that medical research has shown little interest in this long-known potential and has not sought to confirm promising options by means of controlled studies. Fibrotic and inflammatory systemic diseases and those in which leucocytic chemotaxis play a role seem to be particularly predestined for this.",European journal of medical research,11309227,2001
The association between frozen shoulder and Dupuytren's disease.,"Fifty-eight patients with the diagnosis of primary frozen shoulder were independently examined by 3 surgeons for evidence of Dupuytren's disease. The disease was found in 52% (30/58) of the patients reviewed. These figures were compared with previously reported figures for a population of similar age. This showed that Dupuytren's disease is 8.27 (95% CI, 6.25-11.2) times more common in patients with frozen shoulder than in the general population; the difference between the two was highly statistically significant (P &lt; .001, chi(2) test).

"Acute postoperative swelling after hand surgery: an exploratory, double-blind, randomised study with paracetamol, naproxen, and placebo.","A model using volumetry to evaluate the effect of drugs on acute postoperative swelling after operations for primary Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was established and validated. The temperature of the saline and time of measurement during the day influenced the volumetric readings. The error of measurement after volumetry of unoperated and operated hands after operations for DC was 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Naproxen (500 mg twice a day), paracetamol (1000 mg four times a day), or placebo were given postoperatively for three days to 35 patients after DC and 42 patients after CTS in a randomised, placebo-controlled study. Hand volume was measured preoperatively and 72 hours after surgery. There was a difference in swelling (p = 0.009) indicating different degree of development of swelling 72 hours postoperatively between the DC and CTS placebo groups, which invalidated pooling of the data. After operations for DC naproxen was slightly but not significantly superior to paracetamol and placebo, with paracetamol numerically superior to placebo. The power of the study, caused by the limited number of patients included, does not permit this difference to reach significance. Operations for CTS caused so little swelling that comparisons were invalidated. Naproxen treatment, irrespective of type of operation, did not require rescue analgesics, while two patients after CTS treated with paracetamol did. Two and six placebo-treated patients required rescue drugs after operations for DC and CTS, respectively. We conclude that naproxen might have a clinical relevant effect on swelling when used on minor surgery in the hand, unlike paracetamol. Naproxen might be a useful analgesic during the immediate postoperative phase.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,11291357,2001
Eighteen years follow-up study of the clinical manifestations and progression of Dupuytren's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical manifestations and progression of Dupuytren's disease.METHODS: In 1981-82 a total of 1297 men were examined for Dupuytren's disease, and of these 19.2% had the disease. In 1999 those with signs of the disease in 1981-82 were invited for a follow-up study. As controls symptom free individuals from the study in 1981-82 were invited.RESULTS: A total of 53 individuals from the control group had developed Dupuytren's disease in 1999. Men with palmar nodules/fibrous cord in 1981-82 were more likely to develop contracted fingers than those without Dupuytren's disease. Patients with young age at disease onset more often required operations than those with later onset. Of the men who had been operated 70% still had finger contractures in 1999.CONCLUSION: The incidence of Dupuytren's disease is high in elderly men. Dupuytren's disease is progressive in nature and most operated patients have recurrent finger contractures.",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,11252689,2001
[Optimization of radiotherapy in Dupuytren's disease. Initial results of a controlled trial].,"PURPOSE: Radiotherapy prevents progression of Dupuytren's contracture. Herein, 1-year results of a prospective randomized trial comparing 2 different dose concepts are presented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 129 patients (67 males, 62 females) were included in the study with a minimum 1-year follow-up: 69 had bilateral and 60 unilateral involvement of Dupyutren's disease accounting for 198 irradiated hands. According to Tubiana, 73 hands had Stage N, 61 Stage N/I (&lt; or = 10 degrees flexion deformity), 59 Stage I (11 to 45 degrees) and 5 Stage II disease (46 to 90 degrees). Radiotherapy was randomly delivered: group A (63 patients/95 hands) received 10 times 3 Gy (total: 30 Gy) in 2 series (each 5 times 3 Gy) separated by 8 weeks; group B (66 patients/103 hands) received 7 times 3 Gy (total: 21 Gy) within 2 weeks. Orthovoltage radiotherapy (120 kV) with 40 cm standard cones and individual shielding was applied. Patient and disease parameters were equally distributed in both groups. Evaluation (toxicity, efficacy) was performed at 3 and 12 months with regard to subjective (patient's opinion) and objective parameters (palpation, measurements, comparative photographs--physician).RESULTS: Acute toxicity was minimal: 76 (38%) hands had skin reactions CTC Grade 1, 12 (6%) CTC Grade 2. Chronic side effects (dryness, skin atrophy, change of sensation, LENT Grade 1) occurred in 9 (5%) hands without differences between treatment groups. At 3 and 12 months follow-up, subjective symptoms and objective signs, nodules and cords, were reduced in both groups (p &lt; 0.01) with no differences between groups: a total of 110 (55%) hands (group A: 55, group B: 55) regressed, 74 (37%) hands (group A: 35; group B: 39) were stable. Overall and mean number of nodules, cords and skin changes decreased at 3 and 12 months. 16 of 198 (8%) hands (group A: 7; group B: 9) progressed at 12 months follow-up (&quot;treatment failure&quot;); at 1 year, 7 of 60 patients with unilateral Dupyutren's disease required prophylactic radiotherapy for the contralateral hand due to disease progression.CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic radiotherapy reduces symptoms and prevents disease progression in early-stage Dupyutren's disease. Both treatment concepts are well-tolerated and equally effective. Acute toxicity is slightly increased with treatment concept B (7 times 3 Gy), while chronic sequelae are low in both treatment groups. Long-term evaluation with follow-up of more than 5 years has to be awaited to recommend one or the other dose concept.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Radiotherapy optimization in early-stage Dupuytren's contracture: first results of a randomized clinical study.,"PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) can prevent progression of Dupuytren's contracture (DC). It is unknown whether there is a dose response and which dose is sufficient. Herein, the 1-year results of a prospective randomized trial are presented which compared two different RT dose concepts with each other.METHODS: 129 patients (67 males; 62 females) were entered in this study: 69 had bilateral and 60 uni-lateral involvement of DC accounting for 198 irradiated hands. According to Tubiana's classification, 73 hands had Stage N (nodules/cords, no extension deficit = flexion deformity), 61 had Stage N/I (&lt; or = 10 degrees deficit), 59 had Stage I (11-45 degrees deficit), and 5 had Stage II (46-90 degrees deficit) DC. Prophylactic RT was randomly delivered; in Group A, 63 patients (95 hands) received 10 x 3 Gy (total dose, 30 Gy) in 2 series (5 x 3Gy) separated by 8 weeks; in Group B, 66 patients (103 hands) received 7 x 3 Gy (total dose, 21 Gy) in 1 series within 2 weeks. Orthovoltage RT (120 kV) was applied using standard cones and individual shielding of uninvolved areas of the palm. Relevant patient and disease parameters were equally distributed in both groups. Evaluation (toxicity, efficacy) was performed at 3 and 12 months after RT. Subjective (patient's opinion) and objective parameters (palpation, measurements, and comparative photographs) were applied to assess treatment response. Minimum follow-up (FU) was 1 year.RESULTS: Acute toxicity was minimal, but slightly more pronounced in Group B. Seventy-six (38%) hands developed skin reactions CTC 1 degrees (A, 30; B, 46); and 12 (6%) had skin reactions CTC 2 degrees (A, 4; B, 8). Chronic side effects were limited to dryness, desquamation, skin atrophy, and change of sensation (LENT 1 degrees ) in 9 (5%) sites without differences between the two groups. At 3 and 12 months after RT, subjective and objective reduction of symptoms, nodules, and cords occurred in both groups (p &lt; 0.01) with no differences between the groups: in Group A, 55 (56%) sites regressed, 35 (37%) remained stable, and 7 (7%) progressed, whereas in Group B, 55 (53%) regressed, 39 (38%) remained stable, and 9 (9%) progressed at 12 months FU (NS). Overall and mean number of nodules, cords, and skin changes decreased at 3 and 12 months. The &quot;treatment failure&quot; rate at 1 year was 16 of 198 (8%), but only 4 (2%) sites required hand surgery for disease progression. Seven of 60 patients with unilateral DC received prophylactic RT for the initially uninvolved, contralateral hand due to progression of DC.CONCLUSION: Both prophylactic RT concepts have been well accepted and tolerated by patients. Within the first year, they were equally effective to prevent further disease progression of DC and obtain considerable symptomatic improvement. Although 1-year results suggest similar response rates for both treatment groups, long-term FU of &gt; 5 years has to be awaited for final assessment and recommendation of an optimized RT treatment schedule.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",11172962,2001

The injection of nodules of Dupuytren's disease with triamcinolone acetonide.,"Over a 4-year period 63 patients (75 hands) with Dupuytren's nodules were treated with a series of injections with the steroid triamcinolone acetonide directly into the area of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide could produce softening and flattening in nodules of Dupuytren's disease as seen in the intralesional injections of hypertrophic scars and keloids. After an average of 3.2 injections per nodule 97% of the hands showed regression of disease as exhibited by a softening or flattening of the nodule(s). Although some patients had complete resolution of the nodules, most experienced definite but incomplete resolution of the nodules in the range of 60% to 80%. Although a few patients did not experience recurrence or reactivation of the disease in the injected nodules or development of new nodules, 50% of patients did experience reactivation of disease in the nodules 1 to 3 years after the last injection, necessitating 1 or more injections. The findings of this study indicate that the intralesional injection of nodules of Dupuytren's disease with triamcinolone acetonide may modify the progression of the disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,11119679,2e3

Is the reversed fourth dorsal metacarpal flap reliable?,"We have carried out a study to determine if a flap based on vessels in the fourth metacarpal space could be used safely. We studied ten fresh cadaver specimens and used the flap in nine patients. In the anatomical study, we confirmed the presence of a suitable artery in nine out of the ten hands, arising from a piercing artery at the metacarpal bases, running distally under the fascia. The pivot point is located at the metacarpal heads, where the artery anastomoses to palmar branches and dorsal digital branches. In the clinical setting, the flap was reliable in eight patients. There was one case of flap necrosis. The flap seems to be reliable but several technical points are stressed to avoid complications.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",11062568,2e3

Sonography of the hand and wrist.,"Not only is the anatomy of the hand and wrist complex, but also its pathologic conditions are quite diverse. Although plain radiographs, CT, arthrography, and MRI have traditionally been used to evaluate the hand and wrist, ultrasound is beginning to take its place alongside these more traditional imaging modalities and is being ordered with increasing frequency by orthopedic surgeons. This article reviews the pertinent gross anatomy and sonographic technique used to scan the hand and wrist and also describes the sonographic findings associated with the most common hand and wrist pathologic conditions. These include soft tissue tumors, tenosynovitis, tendinous and ligamentous injuries of the hand, Dupuytren's contracture, foreign bodies, and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).","Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",10994688,2e3
Severe Dupuytren's contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint: treatment by two-stage technique.,"Thirty-four patients with a Dupuytren's contracture in excess of 70 degrees of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint were treated by preliminary palmar fasciotomy, release of the accessory collateral ligaments and PIP joint distraction using the S-Quattro for 6 weeks. A formal fasciectomy with full thickness skin graft was then performed 2 weeks after removal of the fixator. There was a mean residual flexion deformity of the PIP joint of 22 degrees (mean correction of 67 degrees) at an average follow-up of 30 months. There were no infections or amputations. We recommend this technique for the management of severe Dupuytren's contracture of the PIP joint.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10991808,2e3
Changes of biochemical and biomechanical properties in Dupuytren disease.,"BACKGROUND: The major biochemical characteristic of Dupuytren disease is the progressive and irreversible deposition of excess fibrous collagen characterized by an enhanced type III collagen proportion.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of changes of the collagen spectrum on the biophysical properties of the palmar aponeurosis.DESIGN: Variably affected palmar regions from 30 individuals with Dupuytren disease were classified according to histologic test results and clinical stage. Biochemical, biomechanical, and thermal contracture studies were performed.RESULTS: The relative type III collagen content increased with increasing tissue involvement and was found to correlate with calorimetric and biomechanical properties with the exception of the Young modulus. In experiments on the thermal isometric contracture, the collagen denaturation temperature decreased with increasing type III collagen content, ie, increasing involvement. To study the dependence of biophysical properties from the collagen type distribution independent of structural changes, as seen in Dupuytren disease, we investigated rat skins from animals of an age range characterized by dramatic changes in type III collagen content (0-18 months). Biomechanical data also correlated significantly with type III collagen content in rat skin with the exception of the time constant of stress relaxation.CONCLUSION: In light of these results, we suggest that structural changes, such as reduced collagen fibril diameters, associated with alterations in the type III collagen proportion may influence biophysical properties of connective tissues in the involved palmar aponeurosis in addition to alterations of the cross-linking pattern.",Archives of pathology &amp; laboratory medicine,10975920,2e3
Cancer incidence in patients treated surgically for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Our aim was to study risk factors for Dupuytren's contracture (DC) by assessing cancer morbidity in a group of Swedish patients treated surgically for Dupuytren's contracture. The risk of cancer was determined in 15,212 patients operated on for Dupuytren's contracture, identified in the nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register during the period 1965 to 1994 by means of record linkage to the Swedish Cancer Register. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed using age-, sex- and period-specific incidence rates derived from the entire Swedish population. The overall relative risk of cancer was increased by 24%. There were significantly increased risks for malignancies related to smoking such as buccal, oesophageal, gastric, lung and pancreatic cancers. Significantly increased risks were present for both prostate and rectal cancer in men and an increase risk for breast cancer in women was noted 1 year or more after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. The present study confirms smoking and alcohol abuse as probable risk factors for DC. There are characteristics in patients with DC that alter the risks for other malignancies compared with the general population.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10961556,2e3

Enzyme injection as nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Surgical fasciectomy is the currently accepted treatment of Dupuytren's disease. The goal of this study was to test the clinical safety and efficacy of clostridial collagenase injection as a nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease in a phase II open-label trial. Thirty-five Dupuytren's disease patients entered the study (32 men and 3 women). The mean age was 65 years. The first 6 patients were treated following a dose escalation protocol and received 300, 600, 1,200, 2,400, 4,800, and 9,600 U collagenase injected into the cord that was causing contracture of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. There were no beneficial clinical effects of these injections. The remaining 29 patients had collagenase injections at a dose level of 10,000 U, causing contractures of 34 MCP joints, 9 proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and 1 thumb. Twenty-eight of the 34 MCP joint contractures corrected to normal extension (0 degrees ) and 2 of the 34 MCP joint contractures corrected to 5 degrees of normal extension, with full range of motion, within 1 to 14 days of injection. In the patients with PIP joint contractures, 4 of the 9 joints corrected to normal (0 degrees ). One PIP joint corrected to within 10 degrees of normal and 2 corrected to within 15 degrees of normal. There were 2 failures; these patients will require surgery. The mean follow-up period was 20.0 +/- 5.6 months for the MCP joints and 14.1 +/- 6.6 months for the PIP joints. Clostridial collagenase injection of Dupuytren's cords causing MCP and PIP joint contractures appears to have merit as nonsurgical treatment of this disorder. Pending further placebo, double-blind studies, collagenase injection to treat Dupuytren's disease may be a safe and effective alternative to surgical fasciectomy.",The Journal of hand surgery,10913202,2e3
Results after surgery for severe Dupuytren's contracture: does a dynamic extension splint influence outcome?,"Seventy-six consecutive patients were operated on for advanced Dupuytren's contracture and the results evaluated after nine months with special reference to the use of a dynamic extension splint. The patients were separated into three groups: those in whom the splint was used according to our guidelines (n = 15); those in whom the splint was used, but inadequately (n = 15); and those who did not require splinting (n = 24). Our results nine months postoperatively were similar to those of other studies in showing that the fifth proximal interphalangeal joint constituted the greatest problem. Comparison of the three groups indicated that splinting the way we used it did not influence the natural course of the disease after operation.",Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery,10900632,2e3
Racial distribution of Dupuytren's disease in Department of Veterans Affairs patients.,"Dupuytren's disease is a polyclonal fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia of unclear pathogenesis. It has been described as a disease of northern European men and is reportedly rare in other races. A 10-year retrospective study using the Department of Veterans Affairs computer system was conducted to determine the racial distribution of this disorder among patients treated at all Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. The study also determined demographic and clinical characteristics of black veterans treated for the condition at department medical centers. There were 9938 patients identified between the fiscal years of 1986 and 1995, of whom 412 were black (estimated prevalence of 130 per 100,000 population), 9071 were white (734 per 100,000), 234 were Hispanic white (237 per 100,000), 11 were Native American (144 per 100,000), 8 were Asian (67 per 100,000), and 202 were of unknown race. The characteristics of the disease in blacks are similar to those in whites. In both groups, the disease has a late onset, affects predominantly the ulnar digits, and is associated with other medical conditions, such as alcoholism, smoking, and diabetes. Unlike Dupuytren's disease in whites, however, the disease is rarely bilateral in blacks. The differential prevalence among racial groups suggests a genetic component to the pathogenesis of the disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,10883614,2e3
Medium thickness plantar skin graft for the management of digital and palmar flexion contractures.,"The fundamental principle of reconstruction is to replace the lost tissue with similar tissue. Because of the unique similarities in characteristics, plantar skin is an excellent donor area for skin grafting for the palmar aspect of the digits and hand. It provides an ideal color and texture match and long durability with an inconspicuous donor site. However, the use of plantar skin in management of digital and palmar defects is only rarely reported in the literature. Doubts were raised on donor site healing and incidence of recurrence of contracture. There are reports of using full thickness skin graft and dermal grafting from planta in similar cases. We have used medium thickness split grafts from sole of foot in correcting 262 cases of flexion contracture of digits and palms. Thick split skin grafts, full thickness grafts, local flaps and Z plasties were used in numbers of other cases. The technique of plantar skin grafts, application and results with reference to take of graft, quality of skin, donor area healing and recurrence are discussed and compared with available methods and studies.",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,10869831,2e3
Cutaneous manifestations of alcohol abuse.,"Alcohol consumption and abuse can have a variety of cutaneous manifestations. In addition to the well-recognized stigmata of the chronic alcoholic patient, even early abuse can result in distinctive skin changes or exacerbate existing cutaneous disorders. An accurate history of alcohol intake will facilitate recognition of these alcohol-induced cutaneous disorders and treatment resistance of dermatoses such as psoriasis as well as help decrease morbidity in surgical procedures. Familiarization with the spectrum of cutaneous manifestations of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease can also allow for early detection and treatment in an attempt to minimize the medical consequences. We review the medical literature and discuss the spectrum of dermatologic disease associated with the use and abuse of alcohol.",Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,10863217,2e3
Dupuytren's disease in type I diabetic subjects: investigation of biochemical markers of type III and I collagen.,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether biochemical markers of collagen type III and I metabolism show alterations in type I diabetic subjects with Dupuytren's disease (DD) compared to those without DD.METHODS: DD was assessed in a total of 28 type I diabetic subjects, mean age 43.4 +/- 9.5 (SD) and duration of diabetes 25.2 +/- 9.7 years. Concentrations of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) in serum and excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) and deoxypyridinoline crosslinks (DPyr) into urine were measured.RESULTS: The prevalence of DD was 32% (9 of 28 diabetic subjects). Average serum ICTP was 2.7 +/- 0.8 micrograms/l in subjects without DD and 3.6 +/- 1.2 micrograms/l with DD (p = 0.0276). No significant association between other collagen markers and DD was found. The reference intervals of PIIINP and ICTP were exceeded only in 1 and 2 subjects, respectively, and they both had DD.CONCLUSION: The degradation of type I collagen might be increased in diabetic subjects with DD. The overall implication was that synthesis or degradation of type III and I collagen in diabetic subjects with DD did not differ enough from those without DD to reflect changes in the biochemical markers of type III and I collagen.",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,10812494,2e3

Through our 10 patients with Peyronie's disease, when have noticed that only one of them is undergoing diabetes mellitus and no one has Dupuytren's disease. But 7 of them presented clinical and/or electromyographical signs of peripheral neuropathy. So after clinical examination in neurology and urology, we performed measurement of motor conduction velocity of tibial posterior nerves and peroneal nerves, then, we measured sensitive vetocity of sural nerves and dorsal nerve of the penis and we studied the cortical somesthesic evoked potential of the internal hontous nerve and the sympathetic evoked response of the skin. So we hypothesize that peripheral neuropathy with or without autonomic disorders might be an etiological co-factor of Peyronie's disease.",Dakar medical,10797972,2e3
The effect of 5-fluorouracil on Dupuytren fibroblast proliferation and differentiation.,"INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease is a proliferative disease with contractile properties, prone to recur after surgery. Intra-operatively applied 5-fluorouracil has been used to avoid scar problems in the eye after glaucoma filtration surgery and was therefore investigated as a means to inhibit proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation in Dupuytren fibroblasts in vitro.METHOD: Primary cell lines were obtained by explants from Dupuytren's tissue (n = 6), non-diseased palmar fascia from patients with Dupuytren's disease (n = 3) and carpal ligament from patients undergoing carpal tunnel release (n = 3). The effect of 5-fluorouracil on proliferation was assessed by cell counting. Myofibroblast differentiation, an intergral part of Dupuytren's contracture, was investigated by staining for alpha smooth muscle actin, a marker for contractile cells, using immunohisto-chemical methods.RESULTS: A single exposure to 5-fluorouracil caused a sustained inhibition of proliferation in Dupuytren's and non-diseased fascia cultures, whilst the effect on carpal ligament cultures was transient. Untreated Dupuytren's fibroblasts exhibited the highest myofibroblast differentiation, whilst differentiation in non-diseased fascia cultures was shown to be proportional to cell density and virtually non-existent in carpal ligament cultures. After 5-fluorouracil exposure, the differentiation was significantly reduced in Dupuytren's fibroblasts cultures, reduced at high cell densities in non-diseased fascia and unchanged in carpal ligament cell cultures.DISCUSSION: 5-fluorouracil inhibits both proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation in Dupuytren's cell cultures and may have a potential use as an adjuvant treatment to Dupuytren surgery in order to reduce the rate of recurrence and contracture.",Chirurgie de la main,10777424,2e3
[Preoperative intermittent pneumatic extension treatment stage III and IV Dupuytren contracture].,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was the development of a non-invasive preoperative soft-tissue extension device for the treatment of patients with Dupuytren's contracture grade III and IV according to the classification of Tubiana, based on the experience of continuous extension treatment using the external fixator of Messina.METHODS: Intermittent pneumatic distraction (IPD) of soft tissue using a pneumatic extension device was employed for three weeks preoperatively on ten patients.RESULTS: After three weeks the active and passive extension deficit was reduced by 30.02% and 44.64% respectively. Eight months postoperatively an increase of extension on average of 110 degrees was attained. In contrast, a second group of ten patients with Dupuytren's contracture grade III and IV (Tubiana) without preliminary treatment was listed. In these patients, three times a skin graft was needed; in addition, the stay in hospital and time of rehabilitation was longer.CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative reduction of contracture simplifies the surgical treatment and reduces the complication rate. We present a new non-invasive technique for preoperative continuous extension of Dupuytren's contracture yielding at least equal results to the method introduced by Messina. Comparing the two groups of patients, the patients with preliminary treatment had a shorter stay in the hospital and a shorter time of rehabilitation.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",10763127,2e3
"Epidemiology of Dupuytren's disease: clinical, serological, and social assessment. The Reykjavik Study.","Dupuytren's disease or palmar fibromatosis is a common disabling hand disorder, mainly confined to Caucasians of northwestern European origin. The prevalence of Dupuytren's disease and possible risk factors related to the disease were evaluated in a random sample of 1297 males and 868 females, aged 46 to 74 years. Blood samples were collected and biochemical parameters were evaluated. The possible relation between the disease and clinical, social, and biochemical parameters were estimated with age-adjusted univariate logistic regression analysis. Altogether 19.2% of the males and 4.4% of the female participants had clinical signs of Dupuytren's disease. The prevalence increased with age, from 7.2% among males in the age group 45-49 years up to 39.5% in those 70-74 years old. The more severe form of the disease, finger contractures, was found in 5.0% of the men and 1.4% had required operation, while this was rarely seen among women. In men elevated fasting blood glucose (P &lt; 0.04), low body weight, and body mass index were significantly correlated with the presence of the disease (P &lt; 0.001). Dupuytren's disease was common among heavy smokers (P = 0.02) and those having manual labor as occupation (P = 0.018). These results show that Dupuytren's disease is common in the Icelandic population and occupation and lifestyle seem to be related to the disease.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,10760640,2e3
Results following surgery for recurrent Dupuytren's disease.,"This study was designed to assess the subjective and objective results following surgery for recurrent Dupuytren's disease. Nineteen patients (28 fingers) were treated surgically for recurrent contracture and were located for follow-up analysis at a median of 4 years (range, 1-15 years). Seventeen of 28 recurrences involved the small finger and 16 patients had at least one component of Dupuytren's diathesis. For the purpose of analysis the patients were divided into 3 groups: group A (total active range of motion [TAM] &lt; 150 degrees ) consisted of 7 digits treated with limited fasciectomy and interphalangeal arthrodesis, group B (TAM &gt;/= 150 degrees ) consisted of 8 digits treated with dermatofasciectomy and full-thickness skin graft, and group C (TAM &gt;/= 150 degrees ) consisted of 13 digits treated with fasciectomy and local flaps. Total active range of motion reflecting the preoperative, immediately postoperative, and final follow-up values revealed that group C (fasciectomy and local flap) was the only group to maintain a statistically significant TAM improvement from preoperative (205 degrees ) to final follow-up (230 degrees ) analysis. Dermatofasciectomy and full-thickness skin grafting did not prevent recurrent contracture (preoperative TAM = 175 degrees; final follow-up TAM = 150 degrees ). Thirteen patients had abnormal Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing and 8 had abnormal 2-point discrimination. There were 3 anesthetic digits. Despite these findings, 18 of the 19 patients were unconditionally satisfied with their experience and would undergo the procedure again.",The Journal of hand surgery,10722821,2e3

We found recurrence in 12 rays (8.4% of rays; 11.6% of patients) during a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, eight as cords and four as nodules. We suggest that dermofasciectomy is a better method of disease control than fasciectomy for the more diffuse type of disease with involvement of the skin.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Current sexual functioning in 106 patients with Peyronie's disease treated with radiotherapy 9 years earlier.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze retrospectively the sexual functioning and treatment outcome in patients after radiotherapy (RT) for Peyronie's disease.METHODS: During 1982 to 1997, 179 patients with Peyronie's disease were treated at our radiation oncology department. One hundred thirty patients whose address could be traced were sent a questionnaire about their symptoms before RT, treatment outcome, and current sexual functioning (the past 4 weeks). One hundred six patients, mean age 59 years, responded.RESULTS: Before RT, 44% reported painful erections, 97% penile curvature, and 18% erectile dysfunction. Sixty-nine percent reported that after RT, penile pain was diminished and 29% that penile curvature was decreased; 13% reported improved erections. With respect to their current sex life, 51% reported sometimes or always having problems getting an erection and 61% in maintaining an erection; 36% never experienced spontaneous erections. Fifty-four percent reported not having erections rigid enough for sexual activity. Since RT (mean 9 years), there had been a moderate or severe decrease in sexual interest (17%), sexual activity (41%), and sexual pleasure (32%). Overall, 49% of patients were dissatisfied with their current sexual functioning.CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose external RT resulted in relief of pain in two thirds of patients with Peyronie's disease. An improvement in penile curvature was reported in one third of patients. One half of men reported problems in getting an erection. The rigidity of erections was satisfactory in only 54%. There was a moderate to severe decrease in sexual interest, activity, and pleasure after RT; however, this was associated with age, although comorbidity or medications cannot be excluded.",Urology,11113753,2e3

It occurs in young patients and is often localized at the upper distal extremity. Microscopically, epithelioid sarcoma shows nodules manifesting fibrous hyaline cores with central necrosis. It contains epithelioid and spindle cells immunoreactive to keratin, epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin. Recurrences, lymph node metastases and lung metastases are frequent.

Increased mortality in Dupuytren's disease.,"A previous study showed a dip in the prevalence curve of Dupuytren's disease in men over 79 years of age. This may indicate increased mortality. The aim of the present investigation was to study this hypothesis. Four hundred and twenty-six men with Dupuytren's disease, born between 1900 and 1924 were followed for 26 years (1969-1996). Their mortality was compared with that of an age-matched control group of 426 men. In 1996, 361 with Dupuytren's disease and 336 in the control group had died. Overall, patients with Dupuytren's disease had a significantly increased mortality of 22%. The mortality was highest among those with onset of disease before the age of 60. In this age group men with Dupuytren's disease had 70% higher mortality than that of the control group. Disease duration did not seem to influence the mortality.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10597922,1999
Is Dupuytren's disease caused by an imbalance between proliferation and cell death?,"Dupuytren's contracture shares certain properties with malignant tumours, characterized by proliferation and lack of apoptosis, which may be induced by the c-myc oncogene. Because of these similarities, the relationship between the c-myc oncogene expression, bcl-2 oncogene (anti-apoptotic gene) and proliferation was investigated in Dupuytren's disease. Proliferation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of the mib-1 antibody. Results were compared with those from fibrosarcoma specimens, representing a related malignant tumour. Non-diseased fascia from Dupuytren patients and flexor retinaculum from patients undergoing carpal tunnel release without Dupuytren's disease were used as controls. Expression of c-myc was elevated in primary Dupuytren's disease and fibrosarcoma specimens, whilst recurrent Dupuytren's disease, non-diseased Dupuytren fascia and flexor retinaculum exhibited significantly lower levels. Neither bcl-2 nor mib-1 were detected in Dupuytren's disease, non-diseased fascia or flexor retinaculum, in contrast to fibrosarcoma. The imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis, producing malignant growth was thus confirmed for fibrosarcoma, but not for Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10597921,1999
Prevalence of joint complaints amongst individuals with Dupuytren's disease--from the Reykjavík study.,"It has been reported that Dupuytren's disease is very uncommon amongst patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the prevalence of different joint complaints in a cohort of 1297 males, aged 46-74 years, participating in a prospective longitudinal health survey. Joint complaints were less frequently observed in men with Dupuytren's disease than in those who did not have any signs of this disease. When adjusted for age the Dupuytren's patients had less frequently history of morning stiffness (odds ratio (OR)=0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.44-0.98, P=0.04), joint swelling (OR=0.52; 95% CI=0.27-1.00, P=0.05), and attendance to doctors due to rheumatic disorders (OR=0.44; 95% CI=0.15-0.86, P=0.02) than those who did not have clinical signs of Dupuytren's disease. Furthermore, these associations were even stronger after adjustment for other potential confounding factors, such as smoking, lipids, diabetes, education, and occupation. The reason for a negative association between Dupuytren's disease and joint complaints is not clear but genetic and immunological factors may be important.",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,10568426,1999
[Dupuytren contracture: new aspects on form pathogenesis and surgical principle].,"More than 20 years ago, the author formulated the proposition &quot;extension inhibition instead of contraction&quot; to explain the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. This concept and the limited surgery derived from it are presented with preliminary long-term results. The tissue dynamics at the palmodigital zone were investigated. Subcutaneous microdissection and the first slices of adult hands (plastination) served to investigate the intact skin-covered subcutaneous tissue layer. On the flexor side, the hand has a complex skin anchoring system which effects mobile attachment of the digital subcutaneous tissue and stationary attachment of the palmar subcutaneous tissue. The disease fixes the flexion position of the tissue layer and impedes extension of the subcutaneous tissue and fingers. It is not the open but the closed hand from which fibromatosis starts. The principle &quot;retention of flexion position&quot; does not imply a contraction mechanism. The pathological substrate undergoes tendinous straightening by traction. There is secondary hypertrophy of the longitudinal fascicles of aponeurosis. The derived principle of limited surgery leaves the aponeurosis in situ. The preliminary results of follow-up examinations after five years and more show that there is no increased danger of recurrence when the aponeurosis is not removed. Out of 72 hands, 34 (47%) proved to be free of disease. Recurrences were found in 17 (24%) hands.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",10566136,1999
Shoulder adhesive capsulitis and shoulder range of motion in type II diabetes mellitus: association with diabetic complications.,"This study was done to examine the association between shoulder adhesive capsulitis and chronic diabetic complications and diseases closely related to diabetes in Akdeniz University Hospital. Shoulder adhesive capsulitis were evaluated in 297 consecutive type II diabetic patients attending an outpatient diabetic clinic. Shoulder adhesive capsulitis was detected in 86 patients (29%). There was a significant association between shoulder adhesive capsulitis and limited joint mobility (p = 0.006), shoulder adhesive capsulitis and Dupuytren's disease (p = 0.003). Odds ratios (OR) for carpal tunnel syndrome, limited joint mobility, and Dupuytren's disease with shoulder adhesive capsulitis were respectively 1.4, 2.1, and 2.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), respectively, 0.7-2.9, 1.2-3.69, and 1.3-4.4]. Also, shoulder adhesive capsulitis was associated with the age of patients (p = 0.000) and the duration of diabetes (p = 0.03). When other associations between shoulder adhesive capsulitis and diabetic complications were compared, it was associated with retinopathy [p = 0.014, OR = 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.2)], but there was no association with neuropathy or macroproteinuria. On the other hand, the degrees of passive abduction, internal rotation, external rotation motions of shoulder joints in the all patients were correlated with age of patients, duration of diabetes, neuropathy, and the other hands' problems (Dupuytren's disease, limited joint mobility) (p&lt;0.05).

Dupuytren's disease. The way forward?,"Histologically, Dupuytren's disease has been compared to the process of neoplasia because of fibroblast proliferation, recurrence, chromosomal abnormalities and antigenic profiles. However, a comparison of Dupuytren's tissue with the granulation tissue formed in wound healing could be more valid. Histology reveals similarities in cell types, proliferation, vascularity and collagen morphology. Pharmacologically, both tissues have a similar range of agonist and antagonist responses. Biochemical analysis reveals new collagen synthesis, an increased ratio of type III to type I collagen, and similar changes of the ground substance in both processes. Considering such similarities perhaps it is possible to regard some of the models used for the investigation of wound healing and granulation tissue as the missing experimental &quot;model&quot; for the study of Dupuytren's disease. Recently great strides have been made in the basic understanding of wound biology, and such a comparison might well provide novel therapeutic options for Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10473143,1999
[The treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by partial fasciectomy].,"The authors present their own experience in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. From 1977 until 1991, 102 patients were treated with partial palmar and digital fasciectomy. Postoperative complications occurred in 16 (15.68%) cases: infection in 1 (0.98%), skin necrosis also in 1 (0.98%), hematoma in 6 (5.88%) and postoperative stiffness of the hand in 8 (7.84%). Excellent postoperative results were reported in 61 patients (59.8%), good results in 37 (36.3%) and poor results in 4 (3.9%). Twenty-three patients were followed-up. There were 9 recurrences (39.1%) and 11 extensions of the pathologic process (47.8%). In summary, we feel Dupuytren's contracture can be controlled and the patient's hand function can be improved by partial fasciectomy.",Lijecnicki vjesnik,19658371,1999
Dupuytren's disease. A model for the mechanism of fibrosis and its modulation by steroids.,"Dupuytren's disease is a chronic inflammatory process which produces contractures of the fingers. The nodules present in Dupuytren's tissue contain inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and macrophages. These express a common integrin known as VLA4. The corresponding binding ligands to VLA4 are vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) present on the endothelial cells and the CS1 sequence of the fibronectin present in the extracellular matrix. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a peptide hormone which has a crucial role in the process of fibrosis. We studied tissue from 20 patients with Dupuytren's disease, four samples of normal palmar fascia from patients undergoing carpal tunnel decompression and tissue from ten patients who had received perinodular injections of depomedrone into the palm five days before operation. The distribution of VLA4, VCAM-1, CS1 fibronectin and TGF-beta was shown by immunohistochemistry using an alkaline phosphorylase method for light microscopy. In untreated Dupuytren's tissue CS1 fibronectin stained positively around the endothelial cells of blood vessels and also around the surrounding myofibroblasts, principally at the periphery of many of the active areas of the Dupuytren's nodule. VCAM-1 stained very positively for the endothelial cells of blood vessels surrounding and penetrating the areas of high nodular activity. VCAM-1 was more rarely expressed outside the blood vessels. VLA4 was expressed by inflammatory cells principally in and around the blood vessels expressing VCAM-1 and CS1 but also on some cells spreading into the nodule. TGF-beta stained positively around the inflammatory cells principally at the perivascular periphery of nodules. These cells often showed VLA4 expression and co-localised with areas of strong production of CS1 fibronectin. Normal palmar fascia contained only scanty amounts of CS1 fibronectin, almost no VCAM-1 and only an occasional cell staining positively for VLA4 or TGF-beta. In the steroid-treated group, VCAM-1 expression was downregulated in the endothelium of perinodular blood vessels and only occasional inflammatory cell expression remained. Expression of CS1 fibronectin was also much reduced but still occurred in the blood vessels and around the myofibroblast stroma. VLA4-expressing cells were also reduced in numbers. A similar but reduced distribution of production of TGF-beta was also noted. Our findings show that adherence of inflammatory cells to the endothelial wall and the extravasation into the periphery of the nodule may be affected by steroids, which reduce expression of VCAM-1 in vivo. This indicates that therapeutic intervention to prevent the recommencement of the chronic inflammatory process and subsequent fibrosis necessitating further surgery may be possible.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Osteophyte formation in association with Dupuytren's disease.,Three cases in which there was osteophyte formation on the middle phalanx at the site of insertion of retrovascular cords of Dupuytren's disease are presented.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10433443,1999
Development of Peyronie's and Dupuytren's diseases in an individual after single episodes of trauma: a case report and review of the literature.,A case is presented in which a patient experienced the development of both Dupuytren's disease and Peyronie's disease after single episodes of sports-related trauma. These disorders and other fibromatoses are linked not only by similar pathologic features but by increased frequency of simultaneous occurrence. Some genetically predisposed individuals experience the development of the disorders after trauma or after some other factor unmasks that predisposition. A review of the literature with emphasis on the relationship between these fibromatoses and the varied nonsurgical attempts at treatment is presented.,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,10411420,1999
Comparison of palmar aponeuroses from individuals with diabetes mellitus and Dupuytren's contracture.,"It is well known that Dupuytren's contracture is often associated with diabetes mellitus. Palmar fascia from individuals with diabetes mellitus and/or Dupuytren's contracture as well as controls were subjected to differential scanning calorimetry, biomechanical and biochemical analysis. The collagen denaturation temperature of the palmar aponeurosis from individuals with diabetes mellitus in the presence (71.0 degrees C) or absence of Dupuytren's contracture (70. 6 degrees C) was increased as compared with controls (68.5 degrees C), while this parameter was significantly reduced (about 3.5 degrees C) in contracture bands of Dupuytren's contracture. Stress relaxation experiments revealed that the viscous fraction was slightly reduced in diabetes mellitus (6.5%) vs. controls (8.3%), whereas in Dupuytren's contracture, irrespective of additional diabetes mellitus, a pronounced increase of this parameter was seen (36.5% vs. 24.5%) in the presence of diabetes mellitus. The time constants were significantly elevated by both disorders, this increase being more pronounced in Dupuytren's contracture. Taken together, these changes can be explained by increased cross-linking in diabetes mellitus, while in Dupuytren's contracture other structural changes, such as increased collagen type III content and loss of fascicular organization, play an additional role besides the finding of reduced cross linking.",The Anatomical record,10409813,1999
Algodystrophy and its association with Dupuytren's disease.,Seventy-two patients were examined 9 weeks after sustaining a Colles' fracture of the wrist for evidence of algodystrophy. They were examined 18 months later for evidence of Dupuytren's disease to determine the incidence of the association between the two conditions. Forty-one per cent of all patients had evidence of Dupuytren's disease at 18 months following Colles' fracture. Sixty-seven per cent of patients with algodystrophy had evidence of Dupuytren's disease compared with 19% of patients who showed no features of algodystrophy.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10372776,1999
The effect of interferon-alpha2b on an in vitro model Dupuytren's contracture.,"The effects of interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) on Dupuytren's and control palmar fibroblasts were evaluated using the fibroblast-populated collagen lattice model. Three paired strains of Dupuytren's and control fibroblasts were exposed to IFN-alpha2b for 96 hours before incorporation into triplicate collagen lattices. Contraction of the lattices was recorded and Northern blot analysis of cytoskeletal mRNA was performed. Comparisons of Dupuytren's and control fibroblasts revealed significantly increased contractility of the Dupuytren's fibroblasts in 2 of the 3 strains. Treatment with IFN-alpha2b significantly inhibited contraction in both Dupuytren's and control fibroblasts. In Dupuytren's fibroblasts, treatment with IFN-alpha2b significantly down-regulated mRNA expression for cytoplasmic beta-actin and gamma-actin.",The Journal of hand surgery,10357539,1999
Plantar fibromatosis: an immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study.,"The analogies between plantar fibromatosis and Dupuytren's disease (palmar fibromatosis) are well known. The latter is clinically more frequent and has been the object of extensive immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, with a view to investigating its pathogenesis. By contrast, such data on plantar fibromatosis are quite scarce. A histochemical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study was performed on nodule tissue from six patients who were subjected to total fasciectomy for plantar fibromatosis. The study of myofibroblasts revealed features suggestive of their fibroblastic origin and evidenced a cytoskeleton and an extracellular filamentous system that could enable myofibroblasts to generate and exert the intracellular forces that contribute to the contraction of the aponeurosis. These aspects are similar to those observed in Dupuytren's disease and seem to lend support to the theory that the two diseases are expressions of the same disorder.",Foot &amp; ankle international,10229282,1999
Evidence for a polyclonal etiology of palmar fibromatosis.,X chromosome inactivation patterns at the androgen receptor locus were evaluated to determine clonality in microdissected lesional tissue and in leukocytes from 2 women with Dupuytren's disease. The tissue from both patients generated a polyclonal pattern of X chromosome inactivation of the human androgen receptor gene. This finding supports a polyclonal reactive process as the underlying etiology for palmar fibromatosis.,The Journal of hand surgery,10194020,1999
Postsurgical rehabilitation of Dupuytren's disease.,"Postoperative rehabilitation is an important component in the management of Dupuytren's disease patients. Through an effective splinting and exercise program, the surgical outcome can be enhanced. Treatment should be directed toward restoring hand function and monitoring development of complications that could compromise the outcome.",Hand clinics,10050252,1999
Complications of the operative treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Complications of surgery for Dupuytren's disease occur intra-operatively as well as during the early and late postoperative periods. Digital nerve injury, vascular injury, skin flap &quot;button holes,&quot; hematoma, swelling, infection, flare, wound dehiscence, recurrence, pseudoaneurysm, and inclusion cysts are discussed and their treatment reviewed. Recognition of the complication is necessary for motion therapy to proceed in a timely fashion in order to avoid postoperative digital stiffness.",Hand clinics,10050251,1999
Dupuytren's disease of the radial side of the hand.,"The systematic examination and recording, ray by ray, using the author's method of assessment of Dupuytren's disease have revealed that there are more Dupuytren's disease cases affecting the radial side of the hand than usually believed. The aponeurotic structures of the thumb and first web space are described. The location of diseased tissue coincides with the normal aponeurotic structures. Radial involvement alone is rare; most often, radial-side involvement is associated with ulnar-side involvement. Radial-sided lesions in the older patient progress slowly and rarely require surgery. In the younger patient, however, progress can be rapid, can lead to significant contractures, and recurrence after partial fasciectomy is frequent. Surgical management of these aggressive forms requires a large approach and an extensive excision. These cases are the best indications for dermofasciectomies.",Hand clinics,10050250,1999
The proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease.,"A precise excision of the diseased fascia corrects proximal interphalangeal joint deformity in many instances. When excision of the fascia results in a contracture of greater than 30 degrees that has not been corrected to this level by gentle manipulation, then a systematic release of the causative structures is occasionally indicated, paying particular attention to the check rein ligaments of the palmar plate and adherence of shortened collateral and accessory collateral ligaments. Postoperative physical therapy and splinting are necessary, particularly in those cases in which a joint release has been performed. These authors advise against a routine joint release. Ultimately, the failure to regain flexion may be a greater disability than the original loss of extension.",Hand clinics,10050249,1999
Open-palm technique and soft-tissue coverage in Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease remains a condition rich with history and tradition. New ideas in pathophysiology have stimulated research in basic science and the continuing search for the cause. The pathoanatomy, although well understood, challenges the surgeon with difficult dissection and the need to understand the blood supply to the palm. The author still recommends the open-palm technique, initially described by Dupuytren and later popularized by McCash, as the treatment of choice in Dupuytren's disease.",Hand clinics,10050248,1999
Surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"A surgical approach is described that has been used in nearly 200 primary cases of Dupuytren's disease treated by one surgeon. Special attention and comments are directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint, a notoriously difficult area to correct. Observations suggest that the pathologic anatomy of this area is more variable and complex than generally described. The importance of postoperative therapy is stressed.",Hand clinics,10050247,1999
Nonoperative treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Many nonoperative therapies have been investigated for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. These include needle fasciotomy, continuous slow skeletal traction, radiation, dimethyl sulfoxide, vitamin E, allopurinol, physical therapy, ultrasound therapy, steroid injections, radiation, interferon, splinting, and enzymatic fasciotomy. Most of these therapies have not proven to be clinically useful. However, recent investigation of enzymatic fasciotomy using collagenase injection has shown encouraging results.",Hand clinics,10050246,1999
Clinical presentation and types of Dupuytren's disease.,"The clinical presentation of Dupuytren's disease is discussed with emphasis on dermato-pathology, the nodule, the cord, ectopic manifestations regional and distant, and disease progression. The differential diagnosis also is described with a list of pseudo-Dupuytren's disease cases. Observations by this author suggest that there are two distinct clinical entities responsible for palmar fascial contracture, namely typical Dupuytren's disease and atypical Dupuytren's contracture. These two types seem to differ in presentation, treatment, and prognosis. The characteristic clinical findings of each of these two types are described. The disparity among treatment outcome studies and epidemiologic studies with regard to the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease is probably in part due to lack of distinction between these two clinical types. Accurate diagnosis and satisfactory treatment outcome can be achieved by careful history, thorough physical examination, and keen understanding of the pathophysiology of this enigmatic disease.",Hand clinics,10050245,1999
Palmar fascial complex anatomy and pathology in Dupuytren's disease.,"Familiarity with the normal palmar fascial anatomy of the hand is necessary for understanding the convoluted pathologic changes that take place in Dupuytren's disease. This article includes a literature review and the findings of a study by the author of the fascial anatomy and pathology as related to Dupuytren's disease. Gross and microdissection of the palmar fascial structures were carried out with the aid of the operative microscope and an arthroscope, which allowed examination of the fine and undisturbed retinacular anatomy. The palmar fascial complex of the hand has five components: the radial aponeurosis, ulnar aponeurosis, central (palmar) aponeurosis, palmo-digital fascia, and digital fascia. The subtle constituents of each component are outlined and the transformation from normal to pathologic anatomy is clarified.",Hand clinics,10050244,1999
Genetics of Dupuytren's disease.,"The striking variation in prevalence, approaching 30% in individuals over the age of 60 years in Norway, is strong evidence for an inherited susceptibility to Dupuytren's disease. In many pedigrees, inheritance appears to follow the autosomal dominant model. Other modes of inheritance are consistent with the data, however, and it remains unclear whether the many apparently sporadic cases have a genetic basis. The inherited susceptibility may influence tissue's sensitivity to the effects of environmental exposures. High prevalence, late age of onset, and the possibility of nongenetic cases are features of Dupuytren's disease that complicate genetic studies, as can be seen from estimates of relative risk. Identification of susceptibility loci is a worth-while goal as it may throw entirely new light on the nature of Dupuytren's disease and ultimately may open avenues to new treatments.",Hand clinics,10050243,1999
Epidemiology of Dupuytren's disease.,"Studying the epidemiology of Dupuytren's disease allows the identification of populations at risk and may point to inferences regarding etiology. Data suggest the highest prevalence of the disease occurs in people of northern European stock. However, the disease does occur in nearly all populations examined. Dupuytren's disease occurs more frequently in men than women and becomes symptomatic approximately 10 years earlier in the lives of men than in women. Dupuytren's disease has been associated with a number of other diseases including seizure disorders, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking. There is conflicting evidence as to whether manual labor or HIV seropositivity increases the prevalence of the disorder.",Hand clinics,10050242,1999
Etiology of Dupuytren's disease.,"The etiology of Dupuytren's disease is still unknown in spite of significant recent advances in identifying the type of cell responsible for initiating the process. Associated factors such as alcoholism, smoking, work, diabetes, and epilepsy are discussed. The course of the disease in men as compared with women is also discussed. Recent evidence has shown that there may be genetic and immunologic factors involved. Superoxide free radicals and their effect on fibroblast proliferation may play a significant role in the disease process.",Hand clinics,10050241,1999
The biochemistry of Dupuytren's disease.,"The molecular biochemical aspects of Dupuytren's disease have been studied for decades. This article summarizes biochemical influences on myofibroblast contractility, endogenous and exogenous chemical regulation, the influence of growth factors, and the biochemistry of collagen. A clear insight into the biochemistry of Dupuytren's disease may provide a foundation for future clinical interventions.",Hand clinics,10050240,1999
Cellular structure and biology of Dupuytren's disease.,"Numerous studies support the idea that the myofibroblast is a key cell responsible for the tissue contraction in Dupuytren's disease. In vitro models have been developed to study the underlying cellular basis of myofibroblast differentiation and contraction. Studies suggest that the growth factor TGF-beta 1 combined with mechanical stress can promote the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Agonists, such as LPA and thrombin, can promote the contraction of myofibroblasts through specific intracellular signaling pathways that regulate levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain. Agents that can affect these intracellular signaling pathways hold promise as a means to decrease contraction of the myofibroblast and of the palmar fascia in Dupuytren's disease. Finally, the recent finding that IFN-gamma can suppress both the differentiation of the myofibroblast and the generation of contractile force, together with preliminary clinical results using IFN-gamma, suggest the potential use of IFN-gamma for nonsurgical therapy of Dupuytren's disease. Future studies into the cellular basis of tissue contraction should provide alternative methods to improve management of Dupuytren's contracture.",Hand clinics,10050239,1999
The early history of Dupuytren's disease.,Dupuytren's disease may have originated among the Vikings of northern Europe. Possible association of the disease with the Scottish bagpipe-playing MacCrimmon clan and the Papal Sign of Benediction also are examined.

Trisomy 7 and trisomy 8 in dividing and non-dividing tumor cells in Dupuytren's disease.,"Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis is reported in a series of 40 tissue samples from 36 patients with Dupuytren's disease, presenting as palmar and/or finger nodules. No consistent structural chromosome changes could be found. Instead, recurrent clonal numerical abnormalities were demonstrated in 22 of 40 tissue nodules, involving trisomies of chromosome 7 or 8 and loss of the Y chromosome. In addition, we showed that trisomy 7 and trisomy 8 were also present in non-dividing cells.",Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,9973941,1999
[What's new in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease?].,"Among the recent advances in the field of Dupuytren's contracture, the authors reviewed a series of 171 patients treated by percutaneous needle fasciotomy. Among the 198 hands (241 fingers), 65 were reviewed with a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. Mean age was 62 years and delay between onset and treatment 6.8 years. Rupture of the cords was performed only in the palm in 154 cases, palmo-digital in 82 and purely digital in 5 cases. Complications were rare and benign without tendon or vascular bundle injury. Postoperative gain was essentially observed on the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and recurrence rate was high despite the short follow-up (progression of the disease 54% of cases). The ideal indication for this simple and reliable technique is an elderly patient with a prominent cord and predominant lack of metacarpophalangeal extension.",Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,9972651,1999
[Dupuytren disease--formal pathogenesis without contraction and a new surgery concept].,"The palmar fibromatosis holds the finger in the flexed position--extension inhibition rather than contraction. According to this extrinsic concept, only a passive, secondarily reactive effect can be attributed to the palmar aponeurosis. Out of 72 hands examined 5 or more years after an operation in which the aponeurosis had been left intact, 47% proved to be clear of disease.",Langenbecks Archiv fur Chirurgie. Supplement.

T-and B-lymphocyte subsets in patients with Dupuytren's disease. Correlations with disease severity.,"Previous reports have indicated that inflammatory mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease and it has even been suggested that this condition is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder. We investigated peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets from 21 patients with Dupuytren's disease and compared them with ten healthy blood donors. The Dupuytren's patients had an increase in DR+ T-cells compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with both palmar and plantar involvement had a higher percentage of DR+ T-cells than those with only the palm affected. The percentage of circulating CD5+ B-cells was lower in the Dupuytren's patients compared with the control group; this feature was marginally significant for the whole group of Dupuytren's patients but was strongest in the group of patients with both palmar and plantar involvement. These findings support previous suggestions that immunological mechanisms, involving activated T-cells and probably also B-cells, are involved in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9888668,1999
Clonal chromosome abnormalities in a so-called Dupuytren's subungual exostosis.,"We report the first cytogenetic investigation of a Dupuytren's subungual exostosis. The clonal abnormalities found suggest that at least some of these heterotopic ossifications could be neoplastic in nature, instead of being a purely reactive process or exuberant growth in response to trauma.","Genes, chromosomes &amp; cancer",9885985,1999

Dupuytren's disease and frozen shoulder induced by treatment with a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor.,"In a series of 12 patients with inoperable gastric carcinoma who had treatment with a synthetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (Marimastat) for more than one month, six developed a frozen shoulder or a condition resembling Dupuytren's disease. This suggests that the matrix metalloproteinases, a family of naturally occurring proteinases, may be involved in the pathogenesis of these two conditions. Our observation opens avenues for further research which could lead to local or systemic therapeutic interventions for frozen shoulder and Dupuytren's disease.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume,9768907,1998
The effect of shear stress on fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's tissue and normal palmar fascia.,"This study examines the real-time intracellular calcium changes of palmar fascia from normal and Dupuytren's diseased fibroblasts in response to shear stress. The real-time cytosolic calcium changes were measured using fluorescence microscopy image processing. The preconfluent primary cultured cells were exposed to 1 minute of flow at 25 dyne/cm2 after a 2-minute baseline of no flow. Additionally, the cells were exposed to an influx of Hank's buffered saline solution with 2% newborn bovine serum to examine the response to serum-born (chemical) agonists. Cytosolic calcium changes were measured as the percentage change over the 2-minute baseline of the mean [Ca2+]i peak. The mean change of the peak [Ca2+]i response of the normal palmar fascia was significantly greater than that of the cells from the Dupuytren's nodular and perinodular tissue. The response to the chemical agonist showed a robust but not statistically different response between the 3 cell types. Our work supports the hypothesis that palmar fascia responds to mechanical stress, specifically laminar fluid flow. These findings may help to explain that an underlying abnormality in the cells of the palmar fascia may be expressed by exposure to laminar fluid flow, a physical signal, rather than a chemical agonist.",The Journal of hand surgery,9763277,1998
[Does the open palm technique for surgery of Dupuytren's contracture extend treatment and disability duration? A retrospective study].,"In the operative treatment of Dupuytren's contracture stage II to IV according to Iselin and Dieckmann (1951), we often prefer the open-palm technique by McCash (1964). In the past ten years, we have treated 1461 cases of Dupuytren's disease. With the assistance of a health insurance company, we followed up 214 cases. When compared to those cases treated with primary wound closure, there was no difference in regard to return to work time.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9746881,1998
An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline.,"An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture. After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,9698967,1998
Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance that most commonly affects men over age 60 who are of Scandinavian, Irish, or eastern European descent. Local microvessel ischemia in the hand and specific platelet-derived and fibroblast growth factors act at the cellular level to promote the dense myofibroblast population and altered collagen profiles seen in affected tissue. Surgical treatment depends to some degree on patient preference and a clear understanding of the possible complications and considerable postoperative therapy commitment. Operative management is appropriate when metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joint contracture exceeds 30 degrees. A volar zigzag Brunner incision in the digit and palm provides reliable exposure and leads to predictable healing in most cases. The mainstay of postoperative hand therapy is early active-flexion range-of-motion exercises to restore grip strength. A nighttime extension splint is often used for several months postoperatively to maintain the correction achieved in the operating room. Early recurrence of disease is most common in individuals with Dupuytren's diathesis; use of full-thickness skin grafts may be helped for these patients.",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,9692938,1998
Dupuytren's disease in African-Americans.,"Seventeen African-American patients were operated on for Dupuytren's contracture over a 14-year period.

A clinical grading system for Dupuytren's contracture.,"A clinical classification for Dupuytren's contracture of the hand is described. The classification system has been used to sort patients with Dupuytren's contracture into five broad surgical categories and takes into account predisposing factors, risk of recurrence and sympathetic tone in the individual patient. The system has many advantages in determining the approximate operation time and surgical experience required to treat patients. One hundred and four patients graded by this system have been analysed. There was a broad agreement between expected and actual operating times, with no significant difference between them.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9665513,1998
Mechanical stress in vitro induces increased expression of MMPs 2 and 9 in excised Dupuytren's disease tissue.,"We have previously shown that the ability to mechanically extend Dupuytren's contractures in vivo by the Continuous Elongation Technique before surgery resulted in increased metalloproteinase activity. However, under these conditions it was not possible to show whether the response was proportional to the mechanical stimulus or was inflammatory cell mediated. Using an in vitro system of controlled extensions in which inflammatory involvement is absent, we have now shown that there is a clear correlation between the load applied to the tissue and the release of matrix metalloproteinase-2. The subsequent degradation of the collagen results in a loss of mechanical strength reported in the preceding paper.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9665512,1998
Biomechanical characterization of tissues in Dupuytren's disease.,"The aim of this study was to characterize mechanical properties of tissues of Dupuytren's disease and to attempt to identify changes due to cellular activity. Tensile tests confirmed the heterogeneity of Dupuytren's disease tissue with distinct stress-strain curves for the three tissue types normally present, namely, cord, transition zone and nodule. The tensile strength for cord tissue was nearly twice that of nodule tissue, but the latter was nearly twice as stretchable as cord. In contrast, the transition tissue had the tensile strength of cord with the stretchability of nodule. It was found that tensile loading stimulated a cellular response as demonstrated by an increase in the creep strain rate of the tissue at 37 degrees C compared with that at 4 degrees C using Dupuytren's tissue in an in vitro culture test. The creep strain rate for nodule at 37 degrees C was more than seven times that for cord at a nominal creep stress of 0.75 MPa.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9665511,1998
"Evidence of ED-B+ fibronectin synthesis in human tissues by non-radioactive RNA in situ hybridization. Investigations on carcinoma (oral squamous cell and breast carcinoma), chronic inflammation (rheumatoid synovitis) and fibromatosis (Morbus Dupuytren).","The splicing variant of fibronectin containing the ED-B domain (oncofoetal fibronectin) occurs in foetal tissues, reparative processes, organ fibrosis and in tumour tissues. Consequently, a supportive effect of ED-B+ fibronectin for tissue remodelling and tumour progression is assumed. A non-radioactive RNA-RNA in situ hybridization protocol for the investigation of ED-B+ fibronectin synthesis applicable in human tissues is introduced. The ED-B+ fibronectin synthesis was investigated in human disease processes, for which the occurrence of ED-B+ fibronectin is well demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (rheumatoid arthritis, oral squamous cell carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and nodular palmar fibromatosis). The ED-B+ fibronectin synthesis could be shown in lining cells and in endothelial cells of synovial villi in rheumatoid arthritis, in stromal cells of oral squamous cell carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma and in fibro-/myofibroblasts in the proliferative and early involutional phase of nodular palmar fibromatosis. By means of double labelling (alpha-smooth muscle actin immunostaining - ED-B+ fibronectin in situ hybridization), the ED-B+ fibronectin synthesis could be shown to be a typical feature of myofibroblasts. In contrast to the often diffuse ED-B+ fibronectin immunostaining, only a few synthetically active stromal cells were observed focally accentuated within the tumour, which were interpreted as hot spots of tumour-stroma interaction.",Histochemistry and cell biology,9541473,1998
The use of a selective axillary nerve block for outpatient hand surgery.,"Although no guidelines concerning discharge criteria after axillary plexus block are available, many institutions consider recovery of motor function as a critical factor. With the midhumeral approach, the four main nerves of the upper extremity can be blocked separately using a peripheral nerve stimulator. The aim of this double-blind study was to block the radial (R) and musculocutaneous (MC) nerves with lidocaine, and the median (M) and ulnar (U) nerves with bupivacaine to recover motor function of the elbow and wrist more rapidly while maintaining long-lasting postoperative analgesia at the operative site. Patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture were randomized into two groups in a double-blind fashion: in the control group (n = 17), each of the four nerves was infiltrated with 10 mL of a mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine, whereas in the selective group (n = 17), the R and MC nerves were blocked with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine each and the M and U nerves were blocked with 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine each. Recovery of motor block was significantly faster in the selective group (231 +/- 91 vs 466 +/- 154 min). However, time to first sensation of pain was not different between groups (707 +/- 274 vs 706 +/- 291 min). In conclusion, this new approach at the midhumeral level enables the anesthesiologist to selectively administer local anesthetics on different nerves.</AbstractText>: Although no guidelines concerning discharge criteria after axillary plexus block are available, many institutions consider recovery of motor function as a critical factor. With the midhumeral approach, the four main nerves of the upper extremity can be blocked separately using a peripheral nerve stimulator. The aim of this double-blind study was to block the radial (R) and musculocutaneous (MC) nerves with lidocaine, and the median (M) and ulnar (U) nerves with bupivacaine to recover motor function of the elbow and wrist more rapidly while maintaining long-lasting postoperative analgesia at the operative site.

In conclusion, this new approach at the midhumeral level enables the anesthesiologist to selectively administer local anesthetics on different nerves.IMPLICATIONS: In outpatients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture, a midhumeral block was used with the musculocutaneous and radial nerves blocked by lidocaine and the median and ulnar nerves blocked with bupivacaine. Recovery of motor function and time to discharge were shorter compared with patients who received the mixture on all four nerves.",Anesthesia and analgesia,9539595,1998
"Immunohistochemical expression and distribution of alpha2beta1, alpha6beta1, alpha5beta1 integrins and their extracellular ligands, type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin in palmar fibromatosis.","Palmar fibromatosis is characterized by changes in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and re-organization of the interactions between cellular and extracellular compartments. We compared the expression and distribution of alpha2beta1, alpha6beta1, alpha5beta1 integrins and their corresponding extracellular ligands, type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin in palmar fibromatosis nodules from 24 patients. Depending on the degree of cellularity and fibrosis, three different histologic phases were identified: proliferative, involutional, and residual. Immunohistochemistry revealed that only stromal cells of the highly cellular areas of both proliferative and involutional phases were myofibroblasts, as demonstrated by their cytoplasmic positivity for alpha-smooth-muscle actin. The ECM, surrounding these cells, was strongly and diffusely positive to type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin, whereas no immunoreactivity was found in the ECM of the fibrotic and hypocellular areas of both involutional and residual phases. Immunostaining for alpha2beta1, alpha6beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrins revealed that alpha5beta1 integrin was expressed and restricted to the myofibroblast-rich cellular areas, whereas no expression was detected for alpha2beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins. By examining serial sections, a co-localization of alpha5beta1 integrin and fibronectin was observed in the myofibroblast-rich cellular areas, indicating that, in palmar fibromatosis, a co-ordinate expression between cellular and extracellular ligand is detected only for the alpha5beta1 integrin/fibronectin complex. These findings suggest that the alpha5beta1 integrin/fibronectin complex may be involved in regulating the interactions between myofibroblasts and ECM in palmar fibromatosis.",General &amp; diagnostic pathology,9489951,1998
Programmed cell death in nodular palmar fibromatosis (Morbus Dupuytren).,"The regular loss of cellularity during involutional phase of nodular palmar fibromatosis (Morbus Dupuytren) indicates a regulated process known as programmed cell death (apoptosis). Using the TUNEL method apoptosis-related DNA fragmentation is detected in numerous cells as a characteristic feature of fibromatosis noduli of involutional phase. By means of double labelling technique, alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry and TUNEL method for apoptosis, it is demonstrated that the cells which underwent apoptotosis are myofibroblasts. As anticipated, the antidote to apoptosis bcl-2 is not detected in involutional phase, but neither it is evidenced in proliferative phase. Immunohistochemically, Fas/APO-1 is shown to be existent in a very small number of fibroblasts in involutional phase. However, in view of the high number of TUNEL-stained cells a significance in regulating apoptosis in nodular palmar fibromatosis seems improbable. Taking into account that the development of the fibromatosis noduli, the expression of myofibroblast phenotype, basement membrane formation and growth factor expression including TGF beta culminates in involutional phase the initiation of apoptotic cell death can be discussed in relation to these growth factors and matrix protein action and the programmed cell death may be considered as the final step of myofibroblast phenotype evolution.",Histology and histopathology,9476635,1998
The use of skeletal traction in the treatment of severe primary Dupuytren's disease.,"In 13 patients (18 fingers) we used two types of external fixator as progressive static splints for the preoperative correction of the deformities of severe Dupuytren's disease before conventional fasciectomy. The duration of treatment was from one to four weeks. At a mean follow-up of 18 months the mean total fixed flexion deficit had been reduced from 138 degrees to 39 degrees and the mean proximal interphalangeal joint contracture from 80 degrees to 29 degrees. The mean total active range of movement had increased from 123 degrees to 175 degrees. These preliminary results are promising, but continued follow-up is needed since recurrence is common.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume,9460968,1998
In the footsteps of Guillaume Dupuytren.,"Dupuytren's disease and its treatment have always been a fascinating subject. The operation technique, Guillaume Dupuytren performed the 12th of June 1831, does not appear obsolete, even today more than 150 years later (1). Almost the same technique as described in the original text was used. Guillaume Dupuytren was, in his time, a surgeon of true genius.",Acta chirurgica Belgica,9457317,1998
[Free sensory or retrograde pedicled fasciocutaneous thenar flap: anatomic study and clinical application].,"In 1993, Kamei et al. presented the &quot;free thenar flap&quot; based on the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. In light of the microsurgical importance of this vessel, we decided to perform an anatomic study. 20 fresh upper extremity specimens were injected with 30 cc colored latex and examined. The superficial palmar branch of the radial artery was constantly found, originating on an average 23 mm proximal to the scaphoid tubercle with an average diameter of 0.8 mm. Normally, five cutaneous branches to the thenar skin and a branch of the antebrachial nerve, securing the sensibility of the flap, have been found. Based on this neurovascular pedicle, a thin sensory, fasciocutaneous flap can be tailored to reconstruct large palmar defects of the fingers. Primary wound closure is possible, provided the flap is not broader than 15 mm. In about half of the cases, the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery anastomoses with the superficial palmar branch of the ulnar artery, forming the superficial palmar arch. In these cases, the flap can be raised as a reversed pedicle thenar flap. To our knowledge, this flap has not yet been reported in the literature.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9424449,1998
Cell behavior and cell-matrix interactions of human palmar aponeurotic cells in vitro.,"The present investigation has been performed to better characterize, in vitro, normal aponeurotic cells in comparison with dermal fibroblasts and with cells derived from Dupuytren's affected aponeuroses. Cells were cultured in monolayer and/or into three-dimensional collagen gels. Cell structure, adhesion, and spreading capability on different substrates, as well as integrin expression were investigated by light and electron microscopy and by flow cytometry. Cell-matrix interactions were also analyzed by gel retraction experiments in the presence, or absence, of RGD peptides and anti-integrin antibodies. Normal aponeurotic cells, compared with dermal fibroblasts, exhibited in vitro peculiar structural features, which were substantially maintained in Dupuytren's aponeurotic cells, irrespective of the substrate they were grown on. By contrast, the aponeurotic cell behavior was different in normal and diseased cells, these latter approaching that of dermal fibroblasts. Normal aponeurotic cells, in fact, were characterized by low efficiency in retracting the collagen gel, low alpha 2, alpha 1, and alpha 5 integrin subunit expression and low adhesion properties onto collagen and fibronectin, whereas cells isolated from the aponeuroses of Dupuytren's patients exhibited higher capability of retracting the collagen gel, increased adhesion properties toward collagen and fibronectin, and higher levels of integrin expression. No differences were observed between dermal fibroblasts from Dupuytren's patients or from normal subjects. These in vitro results are consistent with those previously obtained in situ, suggesting that palmar aponeurotic cells have a peculiar phenotype and that changes in cell-matrix interactions occur in Dupuytren's contracture. Moreover, by comparing data obtained from the retracted fibrotic cords and the still clinically unaffected aponeuroses of the same patients, it may be noted that Dupuytren's disease is not only confined to the clinically involved branches, but includes the whole aponeurosis of the affected hand.",Journal of cellular physiology,9369955,1997
Cytogenetic and interphase cytogenetic analyses reveal chromosome instability but no clonal trisomy 8 in Dupuytren contracture.,"The results of cytogenetic and FISH analysis performed in 26 cases of Dupuytren contracture are reported. Clonal or sporadic chromosome changes were found in 18 cases (69%). Clonal changes consisted of: +2, +16, -10, -Y, add(1)(p23), del(2)(q21), t(3;16)(p21;q24), add (3)(p24), del(18)(q21), t(Y;14)(p12;q24), +mar. The results differ from those obtained in normal palmar fascia used as control, in which -Y and +Y were the only clonal changes found in 2 of 11 analyzed cases (18%). No clonal trisomy 8 was found. FISH analysis performed in 11 cases (centromeric probe specific for chromosome 8) failed to show the presence of a cell population with +8. Clonal and sporadic structural changes were different from case to case and no clustering breakpoint was observed. The significance of the chromosome instability leading to clonal and sporadic chromosome changes not specific to Dupuytren contracture are discussed.",Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,9352799,1997
[Arterial and neural supply of the skin of the palm. Surgical-anatomical findings in Dupuytren's contracture].,"It has been reported that the skin of the palm is supplied by arteries receiving their blood from a radial, thenar, ulnar, or hypothenar arterial system. Interestingly, the middle of the palm has been described as hypovascularized, but detailed informations on number and distribution of blood vessels are not available. By surgical treatment of the Dupuytrens contracture we could show that preservation of the blood vessels and nerves supplying the skin leads to excellent postoperative results. However, our intraoperative observations do not correspond to the picture of a poorly vascularized region of skin in the middle of the hand. During surgical treatment we found between six and nine bundles consisting of one artery, at least one vene, and one nerve in each case. The bundles perforate the palmar aponeurosis through channels, and subaponeurotically a lot of them originate from further proximal than expected. This information should be taken into consideration during the exstirpation of the palmar aponeurosis.",Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,9312993,1997
Safety of silicone liquid in the postoperative management of Dupuytren's contracture.,"BACKGROUND: Recently the New Zealand Department of Health expressed concerns about the safety of applying silicones to open wounds and banned their use. For 30 years silicone liquid has been used for the management and rehabilitation of the injured hand. It has been reported that the application of silicone fluids to the skin and ordinary handling over a period of years of various methyl and phenyl polymers by laboratory workers caused no skin disorders or sensitization, nor was absorption observed. There are no reports in the literature of the safety of the use of silicones applied to open wounds.METHODS: In the present study, 116 hands that had been mobilized in silicone liquid following surgery for Dupuytren's contracture over the last 12 years were reviewed. In the cases of 64 hands, the patients could be traced and contacted, and 47 patients (hands) agreed to attend for a clinical review. The hands were examined for areas of inflammation, granuloma formation and abnormal scar formation.RESULTS: No patient showed any evidence of adverse effects from the use of silicone liquid.CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that the use of silicone liquid, in contact with open wounds of the hands, for the mobilization of the hand following surgery for Dupuytren's contracture has any of the adverse effects reported as being associated with implanted silicone prostheses.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery,9193271,1997
Peyronie's disease is associated with Paget's disease of bone.,"Peyronie's disease is an idiopathic disorder in which an inflammatory fibrosis occurs in the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa which causes the erect penis to become deformed. Peyronie's disease has a prevalence of 1% in men over age 50 years. Paget's disease of bone is a chronic skeletal disease with areas of increased bone turnover leading to pain, deformity, and in some cases arthritis. Because of a high rate of Peyronie's disease in subjects in a Paget's disease industry-sponsored drug trial, we asked whether there was an association between Peyronie's disease and Paget's disease of bone. We evaluated 61 men with Paget's disease attending our clinic for metabolic bone disease in a tertiary referral hospital, reviewed hospital records of all men discharged from our three hospitals with the diagnosis of Peyronie's disease, and mailed a validated questionnaire about shape of the erect penis to 1500 male members of the Paget Foundation. In the clinic population of men with Paget's disease of bone, 51 of 61 (83.6%) reported having normal erections; 10 patients (16.4%) were impotent. Sixteen of the 51 men (31.4%) had developed a bend or deformity in their erect penis which was confirmed by a urologist's examination to be Peyronie's disease. When the men with Paget's disease with and without Peyronie's disease were compared, there was no difference in their ages, years with Paget's disease, or serum alkaline phosphatase level. Upon medical record review, 1 patient of 262 (0.4%) with Peyronie's disease was found to have Paget's disease of bone. The men with Paget's disease returned their questionnaires for a response rate of 44.8% and reported Peyronie's disease with a prevalence of 14.5%. We suggest that Peyronie's disease is associated with Paget's disease of bone. Furthermore, we suggest that Peyronie's disease may be a previously unrecognized complication of Paget's disease of bone.",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,9169352,1997
[Results of interphalangeal joint arthrolysis in patients with Dupuytren disease].,"The results of 226 arthrolyses of the proximal interphalangeal joints of ring and small fingers in patients with Dupuytren's disease are presented in a retrospective study. 52% of cases involved first operations, 48% were operations of recurrent diseases. Proximal interphalangeal joints of small fingers were more frequently affected than those of the ring fingers. Arthrolysis was carried out stepwise in Buck-Gramcko's technique. In 13% of the cases an additional temporary transarticular Kirschner wire fixation was carried out. The results were graded according to extension deficits and the distance from fingertips to distal palmar crease. The average pre-operative extension deficit was 65 degrees. The average extension deficit three months after operation was 35 degrees. The post-operative distance from fingertips to distal palmar crease was 2.5 centimeters. Ring fingers yielded better results than small fingers. A temporary transarticular Kirschner wire fixation did not lead to better results. In unfavourable cases however, this fixation seems to be indicated. Complications occurred in 27% of the cases, mainly involving wound healing.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9303892,1997

Skin replacement in Dupuytren's disease.,"We have reviewed 90 rays in 67 patients who had undergone radical digital dermofasciectomy. Follow-up was from 24 to 100 months. Problems with skin grafts, moving two-point discrimination and active range of joint movement were noted. The recurrence rate in this series was 8%, a very much better figure for disease control than has been reported for standard approaches for Dupuytren's disease. Radical digital dermofasciectomy is strongly recommended for all cases of recurrent Dupuytren's disease requiring reoperation and as a primary procedure when there is significant skin involvement.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9149986,1997
Day care surgery for advanced Dupuytren's contracture.,"Seventy-six consecutive patients suffering from advanced Dupuytren's contracture were analysed in order to evaluate the safety of day care surgery. The complication rates for haematoma, necrosis, infection and reflex sympathetic dystrophy were acceptable, but we found an unacceptably high percentage of nerve lesions. Day care treatment was achieved in all but seven cases. We concluded that advanced Dupuytren's contracture can be treated by day care surgery but the operations should be performed by surgeons who are skilled in hand surgery, and individual selection of patients with recurrence seems advisable.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",9149985,1997
Current surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"The practice of surgery for Dupuytren's contracture is changing. Most surgery can be carried out under regional or local anaesthesia on a day case basis.

Dupuytren's disease may extend beyond the wrist crease in continuity.,"Debate continues about the origin of Dupuytren's disease, which is usually in the palm but is seen elsewhere as ectopic lesions. We describe a young patient with Dupuytren's disease extending proximal to the wrist crease in continuity with the palmar lesion. Our findings support the view that the condition starts within the palmar connective tissue, but there is no palmar aponeurosis in the forearm and the proximal extension probably started in the deep layer of the superficial fascia.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

"Smoking, alcohol and the risk of Dupuytren's contracture.","We investigated the association of Dupuytren's contracture with smoking and with alcohol by a case-control study in which 222 patients having an operation for this condition were matched for age, operation date and gender with control patients having other orthopaedic operations. Fifty of the cases were also each matched with four community controls. Data were collected by postal questionnaire. Dupuytren's contracture needing operation was strongly associated with current cigarette smoking (adjusted odds ratio 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 5.2)). The mean lifetime cigarette consumption was 16.7 pack-years for the cases compared with 12.0 pack-years for the controls (p = 0.016). Dupuytren's contracture was also associated with an Alcohol Use Disorders Test score greater than 7 (adjusted odds ratio 1.9 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.57)). Mean weekly alcohol consumption was 7.3 units for cases and 5.4 units for controls (p = 0.016). The excess risk associated with alcohol did not appear to be due to a confounding effect of smoking, or vice versa. Smoking increases the risk of developing Dupuytren's contracture and may contribute to its prevalence in alcoholics, who tend to smoke heavily.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Myofibroblasts of palmar fibromatosis co-express transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor.,"Several studies have shown that different growth factors are involved in the pathogenesis of palmar fibromatosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and its cellular receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), are expressed in palmar fibromatosis. Nodules from 20 patients with palmar fibromatosis and control normal palmar fascias were studied by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting demonstrated that palmar fibromatosis nodules contained high levels of TGF-alpha and EGF-R messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, while normal fascias showed only low levels. Depending on the degree of cellularity and fibrosis, the three following histological phases were recognized in palmar fibromatosis nodules: proliferative, involutional, and residual. Immunohistochemistry, using alpha-smooth muscle actin as a cellular marker for myofibroblasts, revealed that TGF-alpha and EGF-R are co-expressed by myofibroblasts in the highly cellular areas of both proliferative and involutional phases, while they are absent or only focally detectable in the fibroblasts of normal fascia and in hypocellular and fibrotic areas of both involutional and residual phases. The restricted co-expression of TGF-alpha and EGF-R to myofibroblasts, the proliferating cellular component of nodules, suggests that an autocrine and/or juxtacrine growth stimulation by TGF-alpha via the EGF-R may be involved in the pathogenesis of palmar fibromatosis.",The Journal of pathology,9120728,1997
Myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix glycoproteins in palmar fibromatosis.,"We investigated immunohistochemically the presence of myofibroblasts and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) in palmar fibromatosis nodules, obtained from 30 patients. Histologically, the three following phases were identified in palmar fibromatosis nodules: proliferative, involutional, and residual. A variable association of these phases was simultaneously detected within the same nodule. In most cases (20/30), we found that involutional and residual phases coexisted, while the association of proliferative/involutional/residual and proliferative/involutional phases was observed in 8 and 2 cases, respectively. Alpha-smooth muscle actin, a reliable marker for myofibroblastic cellular phenotype, revealed that most spindle-shaped cells of cellular areas of both proliferative and involutional phases were myofibroblasts. Regardless of the predominant association of histologic phases, these findings demonstrate that a myofibroblastic cellular component is constantly found in palmar fibromatosis nodules, although its degree is variable. Immunohistochemical study of ECM showed that collagen types IV, VI, laminin, and fibronectin were strongly expressed and restricted to cellular areas of involutional and residual phases. A combined study of cellular phenotype and ECM, using consecutive sections, demonstrated that the distritubion of collagen types IV, VI, laminin, and fibronectin followed the distribution of myofibroblasts, while they were not expressed in the areas devoid of these cells. These findings suggest that interactions between myofibroblasts and these surrounding ECM glycoproteins may be involved in the pathophysiology of palmar fibromatosis.",General &amp; diagnostic pathology,9065582,1997

"[Radiotherapy in the early stage of Dupuytren's disease. The indications, technic and long-term results].","AIM: Radiotherapy was applied in our clinic to prevent the disease progression in early stage Dupuytren's contracture. Initial response, long-term outcome, acute and late toxicity of the treatment were evaluated in a retrospective analysis.PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1982 and 1993, 96 patients (142 hands) received orthovoltage radiotherapy, which consisted of 2 radiotherapy courses with daily fractionation of 5 x 3 Gy (total dose: 30 Gy) separated by a 6 weeks interval. The Dupuytren's contracture was staged according to the classification of Tubiana et al. [38]. The initial evaluation was performed 3 months after completion of radiotherapy, while long-term outcome was analysed at last follow-up between February and April 1994. The mean follow-up was 6 +/- 2 (range 1 to 12) years. Fifty-seven patients with a follow-up of &gt; or = 5 (median 7,5; mean 9,5 to 12) years were separately evaluated for long-term outcome, i.e. prevention of disease progression. Acute and late treatment toxicity was assessed using the RTOG/EORTC criteria.RESULTS: According to stage, 130 (92%) cases remained stable at 3 months follow-up, 10(7%) improved and 2 (1%) progressed. An objective reduction of symptomatic cords and nodules was achieved in 107 (75%) cases at 3 months follow-up. Moreover, 87% of the patients reported a subjective relief of symptoms. In long-term follow-up, only 16 of 142 (11%) cases had progressed according to stage. In the group with a minimum follow-up of 5 years (n = 57), 44 (77%) patients experienced no progression, while 13 (23%) progressed inside (8 cases) or outside (5 cases) of the radiotherapy field. Many &quot;failures&quot; could have been avoided with appropriate choice of larger safety margins included in the treated portals, however, most failures were successfully managed by a second radiotherapy or hand surgery.CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy prevents disease progression for early stage Dupuytren's contracture. Thus, an otherwise necessary surgical procedure in advanced stages of Dupuytren's contracture can be avoided. Moreover, in case of disease progression despite radiotherapy a second radiotherapy or salvage operation is still feasible.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Dupuytren's disease and the relationship between the transverse and longitudinal fibers of the palmar fascia: a dissection study.,"Dupuytren's disease is characterized clinically by a proliferative fibrous contracture of the palmar or digital fascia. A logical approach to the assessment and treatment of this complex condition requires a precise knowledge of the anatomy of the palmar fascia. This dissection study was carried out on ten cadaveric hands to determine the relationship between the longitudinal and transverse fibers of the palmar fascia. We found that the deepest layer of the three longitudinal layers of the palmar fascia (layer 3) divided at the transverse fibers into two sub-layers. Fibers of the deeper sub-layer passed dorsally, proximal to the transverse fibers of the palmar fascia, whereas the more superficial fibers of layer 3 passed dorsally distal to the transverse fibers. The literature is reviewed and the significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",9058016,1997
Dupuytren's disease: association with chronic diabetic complications.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease and its association with the clinical characteristics in subjects with type I (insulin dependent) and II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes. To examine the association between Dupuytren's disease and chronic diabetic complications.METHODS: We studied 297 patients with type I [age (mean +/- SD) 33.2 +/- 10.0 yrs] and 139 with type II diabetes [age 61.3 +/- 12.3 yrs]. We investigated the presence of Dupuytren's disease, limited joint mobility, and the following complications: retinopathy, micro- and macroalbuminuria, and somatic peripheral symmetrical polyneuropathy (neuropathy).RESULTS: The prevalence of Dupuytren's disease was 14% in type II patients; prevalence was the same in both sexes. Dupuytren's was associated with age and duration of diabetes in type I patients (p &lt; 0.001). Its presence was significantly related to retinopathy, neuropathy, limited joint mobility, and shoulder capsulitis in type I and to macroalbuminuria in type II patients, by chi-squared test. However, all these associations, except to macroalbuminuria in type II subjects, disappeared when the confounding effect of age and duration of diabetes was controlled by logistic regression analysis.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Dupuytren's was the same in type I and II subjects although type I subjects were younger. No sex difference of the prevalence of Dupuytren's was seen in patients with diabetes. The disease was associated with macroalbuminuria in type II subjects independent of time related variables. Other associations between Dupuytren's disease and diabetic complications were explained by time related variables in type I and in type II subjects.",The Journal of rheumatology,9002027,1997
Contraction of collagen lattices by cells from Dupuytren's nodules.,"The aim of this study was to see if nodular cells in Dupuytren's disease differed from dermal cells in their contractile capacity and motility. Ten surgical specimens from patients with Dupuytren's disease and contracture of the finger of more than 45 degrees were harvested and the nodular cells were explanted and cultured. Dermal fibroblasts from the forearm were used as control cells. Both types of cell had the same growth pattern. The morphology on confocal laser scanning microscopy was also similar in both types of cell. Dermal control cells caused significantly more contraction of collagen lattices compared with fibroblasts from nodules of Dupuytren's contracture. The F-actin content was equal in both groups. Platelet derived growth factor, PDGF-BB (but not PDGF-AA), increased the chemotactic activity of both cell types, but there were no differences between them. The results indicate that at a late state of the disease cells from Dupuytren's nodules lose their contractile capacity and regain a phenotype resembling that of dermal fibroblasts.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8982933,1996
Long-term results after segmental aponeurectomy for Dupuytren's disease.,"Segmental aponeurectomy has been proposed as a less extensive procedure for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease to limit the incidence of wound complications and stiffness associated with wide dissections. Analysis of the late results showed that the operation brought a lasting correction of the contracture. In hands which did not show any sign of progression of the disease, the follow-up values were even slightly better than the immediate postoperative measurements. It also showed that the proportions of recurrences, extensions and hands free of the disease are similar to those after other procedures and that the type of operation does not appear to be related to the progression of Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8982932,1996
[Complications of surgery of Dupuytren disease. Comparison of total and partial aponeurectomy].,"Total and partial aponeurectomy are the most usual operations performed for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. Eighteen patients, for a sum of 23 treated hands, were submitted to total aponeurectomy in 20 cases and to partial aponeurectomy in 3 cases. Recurrence was present in 4 cases. Postoperative morbidity was 50% (10/20 cases) following total aponeurectomy and 0% (0/3 cases) following partial aponeurectomy. In patient with recurrence disease postoperative complications were present in 3/4 cases (75%) while in patients, operated for the first time, morbidity rate was 36.8% (7/19 cases). Postoperative complications following total aponeurectomy are extremely frequent, especially if recurrence is present. Partial aponeurectomy allows to achieve functional result as good as total aponeurectomy with significative reduction of postoperative morbidity.",Annali italiani di chirurgia,9214276,1996
[Expression of various monoclonal antibodies in nodules and band stage in Dupuytren's disease].,"In 42 seronegative patients (n = 6 normal fascia, n = 12 nodal stage of Dupuytren's contracture, n = 24 stage IV) we performed immunohistochemical examinations of specimens of four locations of the digitopalmar fascia by means of indirect immunofluorescence tests. We determined the expression of monoclonal antibodies against vimentin, leucocyte common antigen (LCA, CD 45), four macrophage-antigens (27E10, RM3/1, 25F9, CD68), PDGFR-beta subunit (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). In 12 specimens of nodal stage disease macrophage-antigens typical for late inflammatory phase was detected. Other macrophage phenotypes were found to a lesser degree. All of these antigens were negative in normal palmar fascia and only sporadically positive in stage IV disease. PDGFR, which has not been investigated in digitopalmar flexion contracture before, has been expressed in cells of Dupuytren's disease as well as in normal fascia to a minor degree. In nodal stage disease, PDGFR-expression was not generally increased, although the majority of these cases showed intensively dyed clusters. EGFR could neither be detected in nodal or cord-stage of Dupuytren's disease, nor in normal digitopalmar fascia.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",9064258,1996
Pharmacologic regulation of Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction in vitro.,"Dupuytren's disease is associated with contraction of specialized fibroblasts present in the diseased palmar fascia. Pharmacologic agents were evaluated for their ability to promote or inhibit contraction of Dupuytren's fibroblasts in vitro using a collagen lattice contraction assay. In the first part of the study, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), serotonin, angiotensin II, and prostaglandin F2 alpha were tested for their ability to promote Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction. Lysophosphatidic acid was found to significantly promote Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction as compared with controls. This response to LPA is dose dependent, with a half-maximal response of 0.07 microM. Angiotensin II, serotonin, and prostaglandin F2 alpha at 1 mM, induced a significant amount of contraction as compared to controls, but the amount of contraction was at least six times less than that observed for LPA. In the second part of the study, prostaglandins E1 and E2 or the calcium blockers nifedipine and verapamil were tested for their ability to inhibit LPA-promoted contraction. It was found that both types of inhibitors partially block LPA-promoted contraction of Dupuytren's fibroblasts. The effect of the various pharmacologic agents on normal palmar fibroblasts was not evaluated. The focus of this study was to examine the regulation of contraction of Dupuytren's fibroblasts. This study demonstrates that LPA is a potent agonist of Dupuytren's fibroblast contraction and that this contraction can be inhibited by specific pharmacologic agents. These findings provide a rational basis for investigating further the clinical use of the calcium channel blockers nifedipine or verapamil and prostaglandins E1 and E2 to control Dupuytren's disease and possibly other fibrotic conditions.",The Journal of hand surgery,8969433,1996
Aggressive polyfibromatosis: a 10 year follow-up.,Polyfibromatosis syndrome is a condition characterized by the occurrence of several cutaneous fibrotic conditions including Dupuytren's contracture and keloid formation.

The underlying pathogenesis and management of this uncommon condition is discussed.,The Australasian journal of dermatology,8961590,1996
Radiotherapy for prevention of disease progression in early-stage Dupuytren's contracture: initial and long-term results.,"PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) was given to prevent disease progression in early-stage Dupuytren's contracture. Initial response, long-term outcome, and treatment toxicity were evaluated.METHODS: Between 1982 and 1993, 96 patients (142 hands) received orthovoltage RT, which consisted of two courses with daily fractionation of 5 x 3 Gy (total dose 30 Gy) separated by a 6-week interval. The extent of disease was staged according to the classification of Tubiana et al.. Initial evaluation was performed 3 months after completion of RT; long-term outcome was analyzed at last follow-up (i.e., between February and April 1994). The mean follow-up was 6 +/- 2 (range 1-12) years. Fifty-seven patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 (median 7.5; mean 9.5-12) years were separately evaluated for long-term outcome (i.e., prevention of disease progression). Acute and late treatment toxicity was assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/EORTC criteria.RESULTS: According to stage, 130 cases (92%) remained stable at 3 months follow-up, 10 improved (7%), and 2 progressed (1%). An objective reduction of symptomatic cords and nodules was achieved in 107 cases (75%) at 3 months follow-up. Moreover, 87% of the patients reported a subjective relief of symptoms. In long-term follow-up, only 16 of 142 cases (11%) had progressed according to stage. In the group with minimum follow-up 5 years (n = 57), 44 patients (77%) experienced no disease progression, whereas 13 progressed (23%) inside [8 cases (14%)] or outside [5 cases (9%)] of the RT field. Most failures could have been avoided with appropriate choice of larger safety margins included in the treated portals; however, the failures outside were still amenable for another RT course.CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy is effective to prevent disease progression for early-stage Dupuytren's contracture. Thus, it helps to avoid an otherwise necessary surgical procedure which is performed in adavanced stages of Dupuytren's contracture.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",8960518,1996
Complications following surgical treatment for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's disease is a proliferative fibroplasia that can lead to a significant contracture of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints, causing a functional disability. Surgical excision of the Dupuytren's tissue and release of the contracted joints may be necessary to restore function. Most patients require hand therapy postoperatively. Postoperative complications have been reported at 17%. These include excessive inflammation, hematoma, ischemic skin necrosis, infection, granuloma formation, transient paresthesia, scar contracture, persistent proximal interphalangeal (PIP) flexion contracture, distal interphalangeal (DIP) hyperextension deformity, joint stiffness, poor flexion and grip strength, pain, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). The hand therapist plays a vital role in the early detection and treatment of many of these complications.",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,8994009,1996
Microfilament system in the microvascular endothelium of the palmar fascia affected by mechanical stress applied from outside.,The effect of externally applied mechanical stress was investigated by thin section electron microscopy of the microvessels in the unaffected palmar fascia in the carpal tunnel syndrome and in patients with Dupuytren's contracture before and after application of a continuous elongation device. In the unaffected palmar fascia the microfilaments of the endothelial cells were connected to a few adherens junctions and focal contacts; stress fibres were absent. In the cord of Dupuytren's disease the microfilaments were increased in quantity. The length ratios of the connections with the lateral and basal cell membrane were significantly higher than in the control group and increased to an even greater extent in the continuously extended fascia. Stress fibres appeared in the endothelial cells of postcapillary venules in the nonextended cord and in the endothelium of both arterioles and venules after extension elongation. the numerous intermediate filaments and the rare microtubules remained unchanged in the endothelial cells of all palmar fasciae analysed. In the endothelial cells of the microvessels the mechanical stress applied from outside mainly affected the contractile component of the cytoskeleton.,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,8917718,1996
Regulation of proliferation and platelet-derived growth factor expression in palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren contracture) by mechanical strain.,"Palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren contracture) causes fibrosis of specific palmar fascial bands. These bands are subjected to repetitive mechanical strain in situ. Primary cell cultures were derived from (a) palmar fibromatosis from eight patients, (b) uninvolved palmar fascia (Skoog's fibers) from four of these patients, and (c) normal palmar fascia from four additional patients. The cells were plated onto collagen-coated membranes either subjected to cyclic strain (25% maximal strain at 1 Hz) or without strain. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation showed an increase in proliferation in all cultures subjected to strain. This increase was highest for palmar fibromatosis (10 to 40% nuclear incorporation, p = 0.02). Skoog's fibers and fascia from the normal individuals showed a trend (not significant) toward increase with strain (8 to 25%, p = 0.15 for Skoog's fibers, and 8 to 15%, p = 0.45 for normal fascia). Cyclic strain increased the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-A relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in palmar fibromatosis (2.2 to 3.5, p = 0.05) and Skoog's fibers (0.8 to 2.0, p = 0.04). The expression of platelet-derived growth factor-B relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was enhanced by cyclic strain only in the fibromatosis tissue (0.7 to 2.1, p = 0.04). The normal fascia did not express platelet-derived growth factor. Platelet-derived growth factor neutralizing antibody decreased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in fibromatosis cultures subjected to cyclic strain to near levels for those grown in the absence of strain (38 to 16%, p = 0.05). Conditioned medium from fibromatosis cells grown under stain showed a trend toward increased proliferation in additional fibromatosis cultures compared with conditioned medium from fibromatosis cells grown without strain (9 to 15% nuclear incorporation, p = 0.20). The observed palmar fibromatosis contracture can be partially explained on the basis of the cell's response to cyclic strain, which may be mediated by platelet-derived growth factor.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,8893764,1996

Molecular genetic and immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor suppressor genes Rb and p53 in palmar and aggressive fibromatosis.,"This pilot project analyzed the tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb in 13 cases of aggressive fibromatoses and six cases of palmar fibromatoses (Dupuytren contracture). Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand confirmation polymorphism analysis, and Southern blot to detect gene rearrangements were used. No abnormalities were detected in p53. The aggressive fibromatoses demonstrated a lack of Rb immunohistochemical staining and decreased mRNA for Rb. No structural mutation in the coding sequence of the Rb gene was detected. The decreased level of Rb gene expression, despite a normal coding sequence, may indicate increased proliferation and may suggest potential treatment schemes.","Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",8866233,1996

Dupuytren's disease occurring after a surgical injury to the hand.,"We report three clinical cases in which Dupuytren's disease was triggered by surgical trauma. All patients developed the contracture between 3 weeks and 3 months after operation for unrelated pathology of the hand. They had significant swelling of the hand postoperatively, preventing full mobilization. They did not have a strong diathesis for the disease. Since the appearance of the contracture, they have not developed the disease in the contralateral hand or anywhere else in the body. In one case, a similar operation on the contralateral band has not provoked onset of the disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8856538,1996
Free flaps as flow-through vascular conduits for simultaneous coverage and revascularization of the hand or digit.,"In complex extremity injuries, which include volar skin loss and ischemic digits, simultaneous coverage and revascularization are required. In this series of 12 patients, free-tissue transfers were utilized to provide both soft tissue coverage and a flow-through arterial conduit for revascularization. Eleven cases involved the hand or digits, and one case involved the great toe. Six cases were performed for acute ischemia associated with traumatic soft-tissue loss. The remaining six flaps were utilized to lengthen contracted vascular pedicles and provide vascularized soft-tissue coverage during reconstruction of severe hand and foot contractures. Nine temporoparietal fascia free flaps were used for hand or digit revascularization. Two fillet flaps were created, one from a nonreplantable foot and another from an isolated index amputation. The distal end of the axial artery of the flap was anastomosed to a digital artery to restore circulation. Fascial flaps were covered with full-thickness skin grafts. Primary wound healing was achieved in all patients. There were no flap losses or other complications. All the distal parts were revascularized adequately by the axial arteries of the flaps, and functional recovery was good. In this technique, the flap satisfied the need for both coverage and revascularization. Vein grafts were not needed. This series further describes the utility of flow-through flaps in the revascularization of digits.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,8764721,1996
"On permanent retraction of the fingers, according to Dupuytren.","During a lecture on clinical surgery that he gave at the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Paris in 1831, Guillaume Dupuytren established the nature of &quot;Permanent retraction of the fingers&quot;, that has been designated Dupuytren's contracture since the end of the XIXth century. The nosological individualization of this soft tissue rheumatism is analyzed based on a review of Dupuytren's lectures and of writings by XIXth century practitioners; the other two conditions included in Dupuytren's diathesis, namely Ledderhose's contracture and Peyronie's disease, are also discussed.",Revue du rhumatisme (English ed.),8817754,1996
Connective tissue and joint disease in diabetes mellitus.,"Connective tissue is ubiquitous and subject to alterations that result in changes in the extracellular matrix of vessels and tissues leading to the long-term complications of diabetes. This article reviews only those abnormalities of interstitial connective tissue involving skeleton, joints, skin, and periarticular tissues. Abnormalities in the skin and periarticular tissues result in syndromes limiting joint movement, including limited joint mobility, Dupuytren disease, flexor tenosynovitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, stiff-hand syndrome, and shoulder-hand reflex dystrophy. Of these, only limited joint mobility and stiff-hand syndrome occur exclusively in patients with diabetes. In all of these conditions, advanced glycation end products are thought to form as a result of nonenzymatic reaction of glucose with proteins, causing stiffening.",Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America,8799711,1996
Palmar bands in rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic conditions of the upper limb.,Palmar prolapse of the flexor tendons as a result of attenuation of the A1 and A2 pulleys occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions in which the joints of the fingers are chronically flexed. The flexor tendons may be palpable and sometimes visible as longitudinal bands crossing the palm. This can lead to confusion with the palmar bands of Dupuytren's disease. These bands are illustrated in a small series of patients and a serious complication of a misdiagnosis of Dupuytren's disease is presented.

Can Dupuytren's contracture be work-related?: review of the evidence.,"Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a disease of the palmar fascia resulting in thickening and contracture of fibrous bands on the palmar surface of the hands and fingers. For decades, a controversy has existed regarding whether acute traumatic injury or cumulative biomechanical work exposure can contribute to the development of this disorder. To address this controversy, this review considers the following questions: Is there evidence that DC is associated with 1) frequent or repetitive manual work; and 2) hand vibration? The published literature was searched for studies meeting the following criteria: 1) in English or having an English abstract; 2) controlled studies; 3) DC an identified health outcome studied; and 4) the study group exposed to repetitive or frequent manual work, vibration, or acute traumatic injury. Relevant non-English articles identified through English abstracts were translated. The validity of studies meeting the selection criteria was assessed using a series of questions adapted from those of Stock [1991: Am J Ind Med 19:87-107]. Studies that met a priori minimum levels of methodologic quality were taken into account to reach conclusions with respect to the above questions. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each study. Ten studies met the initial selection criteria. Of these, four studies met the criteria for methodologic quality, one addressing the relationship between manual work and DC, and three studies of vibration and DC. No controlled studies of acute trauma and DC were identified. Bennett [1982: Br J Ind Med 39:98-100] found the prevalence of DC at a British PVC bagging and packing plant in which workers were exposed to repetitive manual work to be 5.5 times that at a local plant without packing, and twice the expected prevalence in a U.K. working population previously studied by Early [1962: J Bone Joint Surg 44B:602-613]. DC was observed more frequently among vibration white finger claimants than controls by Thomas and Clarke [1992: J Soc Occup Med 42:155-158] (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3-9), and more frequently among vibration-exposed workers than controls by Bovenzi et al. [1994: Occup Environ Med 51:603-611] (OR, 2.6 95% CI, 1.2-5.5). Cocco et al [1987: Med Lav 78:386-392] found that a history of vibration exposure occurred more frequently among cases of DC than among controls (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-4.4). The latter two studies presented some evidence of a dose-response relationship. There is good support for an association between vibration exposure and DC.",American journal of industrial medicine,8732927,1996
Collagenase in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease: an in vitro study.,"The effects of clostridial collagenase on the tensile strength of Dupuytren's cords was studied in vitro to assess its potential efficacy as an agent for clinical enzymatic fasciotomy. Collagenase was injected into Dupuytren's cords from patients undergoing fascioctomy. Following a pilot experiment, in which a 3,600-unit dose of collagenase induced a 93% decrease in tensile modulus as compared with control cords, groups of five cords each were injected with 150, 300, and 600 units. These cords and a control group of five cords were tested by loading to failure in tension. The ultimate stress and strain to failure were recorded by a video capture technique. All specimens were stained for histologic examination with hematoxylin and eosin for collagen typing with sirrius red. Comparison of the ultimate stress values obtained with published values of extensor forces obtainable by the individual fingers of 40 normal hands indicated that a 300-unit dose of collagenase was sufficient for cord rupture within the average maximum force limits of the extensors of the index, long, ring, and small fingers (p &lt; .02). All samples were in the residual disease stage histologically and contained type I collagen by sirrius red staining. These results indicate that collagenase may be effective in enzymatic fasciotomy of residual-stage Dupuytren's disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,8724485,1996
The role of transforming growth factor beta in Dupuytren's disease.,"This study was undertaken to mark immunologically intracellular and extracellular sites of two common transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) isoforms, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2, in the proliferative, involutional, and residual stages of Dupuytren's disease. The effect of TGF-beta on myofibroblast proliferation was also studied using explant cultures from Dupuytren's nodules in the proliferative or involutional stage. TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and the combination of both isoforms were studied at low and high myofibroblast plating densities to simulate respectively proliferative or involutional disease stage conditions. Our results indicate that TGF-beta1 showed an intense intracellular marking pattern associated with fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and capillary endothelial cells in all Dupuytren's samples, regardless of disease stage. TGF-beta2 showed an intense intracellular localization within myofibroblasts in the proliferative and involutional stages. Fibroblasts in the residual stage did not contain TGF-beta2. Neither isoform was present in the extracellular matrix. Results of cell culture indicate that compared with control myofibroblasts, the addition of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta1 + beta2 had significant effects on myofibroblast proliferation, especially at higher plating densities. However, TGF-beta2 had the most significant proliferative effect.",The Journal of hand surgery,8683048,1996
Severe contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease: combined fasciectomy with capsuloligamentous release versus fasciectomy alone.,"Severe proximal interphalangeal joint contracture in Dupuytren's disease presents a frustrating problem for hand surgeon. Some surgeons argue for fasciectomy alone, avoiding violation of the proximal interphalangeal joint, which may prolong morbidity and result in permanent limitation of flexion; this loss of flexion can be more disabling than a mild flexion contracture. Others favor capsulotomy in addition to fasciectomy, especially for severe contractures, to obtain additional release, arguing that one cannot completely correct secondary contracture by fasciectomy alone. We performed a retrospective review of severe flexion contractures (60 degrees or greater) involving 42 proximal interphalangeal joints in 28 patients with Dupuytren's disease. Twenty-seven joints in 18 patients underwent fasciectomy alone, and 15 joints in 10 demographically similar patients underwent capsulotomy in addition to fasciectomy. In the noncapsulotomy group, preoperative contracture averaged 78.4 degrees. Postoperative contracture averaged 36.6 degrees, with a 53 percent improvement. In the capsulotomy group, preoperative joint contracture averaged 82.5 degrees. Postoperative contracture averaged 36.8 degrees, with a 55 percent improvement. Intraoperative residual contracture for 21 of the 27 joints in the noncapsulotomy group averaged 7 degrees compared with 8 degrees for 9 of the 15 joints in the capsulotomy group. Preoperative proximal interphalangeal joint flexion averaged 100.6 degrees in the noncapsulotomy group and 98.6 degrees in the capsulotomy group. Postoperative flexion averaged 92.2 degrees in the noncapsulotomy group, which was 91.7 percent of preoperative flexion, and 82.7 degrees, which was 83.9 percent of preoperative flexion, in the capsulotomy group. No statistically significant difference was seen in the percentage of contracture correction in the capsulotomy group compared with the noncapsulotomy group at follow-up. The degree of correction initially obtained at surgery using either method was not maintained during the short follow-up period. There was a significant decrease in postoperative proximal interphalangeal joint flexion compared with preoperative flexion following either surgical approach; however, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the percentage of flexion lost. Complications developed in both groups but tended to occur more commonly in the capsulotomy group. This study failed to show any advantage to capsuloligamentous release in addition to fasciectomy in treating severe proximal interphalangeal joint contracture due to Dupuytren's disease.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,8596787,1996

Reduced formamide content and hybridization temperature results in increased non-radioactive mRNA in situ hybridization signals.,"To define conditions for highly sensitive non-radioactive mRNA in situ hybridization on cryostat sections the influence of decreased formamide content and hybridization temperature was studied. The examination was performed on fibromatosis nodules of palmar fibromatosis visualizing the beta actin mRNA of myofibroblasts. The results show that a decrease in formamide content and hybridization temperature is able to enhance the sensitivity of mRNA detection applicating digoxigenin labelled DNA oligodeoxynucleotide. The best hybridization signal could be obtained under formamide-free conditions. In conclusion, a simplified sensitive formamide-free mRNA in situ hybridization protocol using oligonucleotide probes on human tissue cryostat sections is presented. The negative formamide effect is seen as a result of the chemical interaction of formamide with nucleic acid strands. An omission of formamide is suggested if the target as well as the probe are single stranded.",Acta histochemica,9054192,1996

Dupuytren's disease in type 1 diabetic patients: a five-year prospective study.,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify which are the underlying factors in the development of Dupuytren's disease (DD) in diabetic patients and to evaluate if the presence of DD can predict the development of diabetic complications.METHODS: A total of 207 type 1 diabetic patients [age (mean +/- SD): 29.9 +/- 9.5 years] was studied at baseline. A follow-up study was performed five years later in 166 patients. The presence of DD was examined and the patients were assessed in terms of the following diabetic complications: background and proliferative retinopathy, peripheral symmetrical polyneuropathy, and clinical nephropathy.RESULTS: The prevalence of DD was 4% at the baseline study. DD was significantly associated with the age of the patient and the duration of diabetes, but not with the age at the onset of diabetes, BMI or the control of diabetes. DD was associated with somatic peripheral symmetrical polyneuropathy (p &lt; 0.01), a history of myocardial infarction (p &lt; 0.01) and limited joint mobility (LJM) (p &lt; 0.05), but all of these associations could be exclusively explained by the age of the diabetic patients and the duration of diabetes. DD developed in 17 new subjects (2% per year) during the five years of the study. The subjects' age and the duration of diabetes were associated with the development of DD. There was a predominance of the development of DD in women (p &lt; 0.05), and in subjects with retinopathy (p &lt; 0.05), nephropathy (p &lt; 0.05), neuropathy (p &lt; 0.05) or hypertension (p &lt; 0.01), but these associations could also be exclusively explained by the time-related variables. The presence of DD at the baseline study did not predict the development of diabetic complications or hypertension when the confounding effects of age and the duration of diabetes were controlled by logistic regression analysis.CONCLUSION: This study shows that the patient's age and the duration of diabetes are the most important factors predicting the development of DD in diabetic patients. The associations between DD and diabetic complications were exclusively explained by the age and the duration of diabetes. The presence of DD did not predict the development of diabetic complications.",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,8697659,1996
"TGF beta and bFGF synthesis and localization in Dupuytren's disease (nodular palmar fibromatosis) relative to cellular activity, myofibroblast phenotype and oncofetal variants of fibronectin.","Nodular palmar fibromatosis is a self-limited proliferation of fibro-/myofibroblasts associated with growth factor synthesis and abundant fibronectin extracellular matrix deposition. bFGF and TGF beta are potent modulators of fibro-/myofibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, in vitro investigations evidenced a TGF beta 1-dependent regulation of alternative splicing of fibronectin mRNA. To investigate a possible implication of these growth factors in the tissue formation process of palmar fibromatosis, TGF beta 1/2 and bFGF synthesis, as well as TGF beta 1/3 and bFGF tissue distribution, is demonstrated by RNA in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry in relation to myofibroblast phenotype development (alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin immunohistochemistry), expression of different fibronectin isoforms (ED-A+, ED-B+ and oncofetal glycosylated fibronectin immunohistochemistry, fibronectin RNA in situ hybridization) and cellular activity (cyclin RNA in situ hybridization, Ki-67 immunolabelling). The myofibroblast phenotype (alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin), the growth factor synthesis (TGF beta 1 and 2, bFGF), fibronectin matrix synthesis (RNA in situ hybridization with cDNA) and ED-A+, ED-B+ and oncofetal glycosylated fibronectin immunostaining are exclusively localized in the active proliferative nodules (Ki-67 immunolabelling and cyclin mRNA demonstration). Whereas the growth factor synthesis is restricted to the proliferative areas of the fibromatosis only, TGF beta 1, TGF beta 3 and bFGF proteins can also be detected immunohistochemically with a lower intensity in the surrounding aponeurotic tissue. The spatial correlation of myofibroblast phenotype, TGF beta and bFGF synthesis and the occurrence of the oncofetal molecular fibronectin variants (ED-B+ and oncofetal glycosylated fibronectin) in the active proliferative fibromatosis nodules suggests a pathogentic role of these growth factors and matrix components in the tumorous tissue formation process. The presence of the bFGF and TGF beta 1/3 proteins in fibroblasts neighbouring the proliferative nodules may point to a recruitment of quiescent aponeurotic fibroblasts in the fibromatous tissue formation process.",The Histochemical journal,8789403,1995
Does peri-operative guanethidine prevent reflex sympathetic dystrophy?,The use of intravenous guanethidine blocks is an accepted treatment for established reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Some units administer intravenous guanethidine peri-operatively with the intention of protecting their patients from post-operative dystrophy. There have been no studies confirming this protective effect of peri-operative guanethidine. Between 1992 and 1994 we performed a prospective randomized double blind study in 71 patients undergoing fasciectomy for Duputyren's disease. Peri-operative guanethidine did not prevent post-operative RSD in our series.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8770739,1995
"Differential expression of fibronectin splice variants, oncofetal glycosylated fibronectin and laminin isoforms in nodular palmar fibromatosis.","The tissue formation process in nodular palmar fibromatosis (Morbus Dupuytren) was investigated by the demonstration of fibronectin splice variants (ED-A and ED-B fibronectin), de novo glycosylated fibronectin and laminin isoforms (A, M, B1, B2, s chains) in association to the proliferative activity (Ki-67 antigen) and the occurrence of myofibroblast phenotype (alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin). The proliferative noduli of the fibromatosis were characterized by a diffuse immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin, and single cells positive for desmin and the Ki-67 antigen. In contrast to the surrounding aponeurosis as extracellular matrix, components of the whole proliferative noduli were defined: ED-A, ED-B and de novo glycosylated fibronectin, B1 and B2 laminin chain, tenascin and collagen type IV. The demonstration of the A and M laminin chain was restricted to a few cells of the proliferative noduli. S laminin could be visualized in the majority of palmar aponeurotic fibroblasts. As revealed by mRNA, in situ hybridization a de novo synthesis of fibronectin could only be detected within proliferative noduli. There is a positive correlation between the myofibroblast phenotype formation, cellular proliferation and the occurrence of ED-A and ED-B containing fibronectin, as well as de novo glycosylated fibronectin in Dupuytren's disease. The ultrastructural irregularities of myofibroblastic basal lamina and the heterogeneity of the myofibroblast phenotype are equivalent to the variability of laminin isoform immunostaining.","Pathology, research and practice",8822112,1995
[A syndrome caused by separating rags in textile industry: a new clinical entity?].,A group of 104 workers were examined. They were employed in selecting rags and separating the lining from wollen fabrics to be used again as thread waste in the textile industry. The aim of the study was to point out tendon and joint related disorders of the upper limb due to repetitive and forced movements. Twenty-eight (26.9%) workers complained of hand and wrist echography and thermography. In 19 patients (67.8%) clinical carpal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed. Eight workers (28.5%) had Dupuytren's contracture. Swelling of the fingers was found in 23 (82.1%). 14.2% and 28.5% of the workers showed respectively acro-osteolysis and acrosclerosis. The textile industry of Prato shows peculiar characters: the workers employed in selecting rags out a manual job which causes soft tissues and skeletal disorders in a great number of them. The acro-osteolytic and acrosclerotic changes of the fingers seem alike the bone disorders of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases as seronegative spondyloarthritis.,Minerva medica,8684670,1995
Immunohistochemical expression of type VI collagen in superficial fibromatoses.,"The expression of type VI collagen was studied immunohistochemically in 26 cases of superficial fibromatoses (palmar, plantar and penile) using an immunoperoxidase method for light microscopic visualization. The polyclonal antibody against type VI collagen used in this study was isolated from human placenta and its specifity was tested by immunoblotting assay. All cases consisted of multiple nodules showing a variable degree of cellularity and fibrosis. Depending on the predominant histological appearance of these nodules, each case was assigned to the three following phases: proliferative, involutional and residual. Morphologically normal palmar and plantar aponeuroses were included as controls. Immunohistochemical findings showed that type VI collagen was present as longitudinal thin fibers in normal palmar and plantar aponeuroses. A differential expression of this collagen was found in the different stages of superficial fibromatoses. Type VI collagen was markedly expressed as a distinct fibrillar network in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding proliferating stromal cells in proliferative and involutional phases. Its expression completely disappeared from the connective tissue undergoing fibrotic transformation during involutional and residual phases. The results of the present study suggest that type VI collagen is an extracellular marker of stromal tissue proliferation and is involved in the early phases of tissue remodelling occurring in the superficial fibromatoses.","Pathology, research and practice",8838371,1995
[Psychological and psychopathological correlates in Dupuytren's disease].,"The etiology of Dupuytren's disease, a chronic and depressive lesion of the palmar aponeurosis, is still unclear. Numerous factors have been implicated, including psychopathological elements and a stressor psychosomatic response, possibly in the presence of a personality structure which may represent a diathesis. On the other hand, from a psychosomatic point of view, any psychic correlates could be secondary to somatic damage. In order to look for common psychological and psychopathological elements in the syndrome 39 patients were examined by a team of orthopedics specialised in hand surgery during the period 1990-91. All cases were studied by clinical interview, the evaluation of anamnestic data of possible psychiatric importance and the use of Rorschach and MMPI tests. The data obtained do not confirm that specific personality elements or psychopathological factors can be correlated to the clinical symptoms of Dupuytren's disease given that the results are comparable to what may be considered the characteristics of a non-selected but age- and culturally-matched population. There are only sporadic findings indicating neurotic and depressive factors, or senile involution. Likewise, no reliable and uniform stressing events were observed, or particular signs of maladaptation related to environmental reactivity or the disease itself.",Minerva psichiatrica,8583880,1995
The pathology of frozen shoulder. A Dupuytren-like disease.,"Of 935 consecutive patients referred with shoulder pain, 50 fitted the criteria for primary frozen shoulder. Twelve patients who failed to improve after conservative treatment and manipulation had excision of the coracohumeral ligament and the rotator interval of the capsule. The specimens were examined histologically, using special stains for collagen. Immunocytochemistry was performed with monoclonal antibodies against leucocyte common antigen (LCA, CD45) and a macrophage/synovial antigen (PGMI, CD68) to assess the inflammatory component, and vimentin and smooth-muscle actin to evaluate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Our histological and immunocytochemical findings show that the pathological process is active fibroblastic proliferation, accompanied by some transformation to a smooth muscle phenotype (myofibroblasts). The fibroblasts lay down collagen which appears as a thick nodular band or fleshy mass. These appearances are very similar to those in Dupuytren's disease of the hand, with no inflammation and no synovial involvement. The contracture acts as a check-rein against external rotation, causing loss of both active and passive movement.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume,7559688,1995
[Description of Dupuytren disease by the Basel physician and anatomist Felix Plater in 1614].,"Plater's description of Dupuytren's disease in 1614 is explained with regard to his understanding of the anatomy. The current view that Plater believed the disease to be caused by dislocation and shortening of the flexor tendons is based upon misinterpretation of the original Latin text. With the help of his anatomical studies, Plater had proven that subcutaneous ligamentous extensions of the palmar aponeurosis and not the flexor tendons were responsible for Dupuytren's disease. Felix Plater realised more than one hundred and fifty years before Cline, Cooper, and Dupuytren the palmar aponeurosis as the anatomical substrate of the disease.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",7498844,1995

Ultrastructural and biochemical modifications of collagen from tissue of Morbus Dupuytren patients.,"Small angle X-ray diffraction and biochemical analyses were carried out on normal palmar aponeurosis and on tissue from patients suffering from Dupuytren contractures (MD). Pathological tissue exhibits a higher overall content of collagen III. Type I collagen extracted from pathological tissue has a melting point of 0.8 degrees C higher than that of normal collagen. The only chemical differences compared to normal collagen I are 50% overhydroxylation of lysyl residues and a reduced amount of diglycosylated hydroxylysine residues. Analysis of the electron density distribution inside the collagen repeating period of MD-samples reveals disordered molecular packing in MD samples compared to in normal collagen. The disorder, which is higher in the gap region, is considerably reduced upon stretching.",Journal of biochemistry,8543577,1995
A picropolychrome staining technique applied to Dupuytren's tissue.,"Although the histology of Duputyren's tissue is well-documented, conventional stains do not distinguish between the different types of collagen which biochemistry and immunochemistry suggest are present. Duputyren's specimens [nodules (n = 26), cords (n = 15) and dermofasciectomies (n = 6)] were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson's Mallory's, Masson's, and Herovici's picropolychrome stain, and examined for both cellularity and collagen staining characteristics. All stains illustrated the marked cellularity of the nodules, contrasting with a paucity of cells within the cords. The first four stains demonstrated uniformity of the collagen staining within the tissues. Herovici's picropolychrome, however, showed distinct staining patterns for the dermis, nodules and cords, with both purple/red and blue areas. Other studies suggest that those fibres stained purple/red and blue are types I and III collagens respectively. These findings may shed further light on the tissue of origin of Duputyren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7594997,1995
Co-ordinate expression of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin and fibronectin in Dupuytren's disease.,"The expression of alpha 5 beta 1 (alpha 5 beta 1) integrin and its extracellular ligand fibronectin was studied immunohistochemically in 23 cases of Dupuytren's disease using an immunoperoxidase method for light microscopic visualization. All cases consisted of multiple nodules showing a variable degree of cellularity and fibrosis. Depending on the histological appearance of these nodules, each case was assigned to the three following phases: proliferative, involutional and residual. Alpha 5 beta 1 integrin was detected in the highly cellular areas of both proliferative and involutional phases where fibronectin was simultaneously expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Diversely alpha 5 beta 1 and fibronectin disappeared from the hypocellular areas of involutional phase, undergoing fibrotic transformation, and from the fibrotic connective tissue of residual phases. These findings indicate that the expression pattern of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin correlates with the presence in the ECM of the corresponding ligand fibronectin during the different phases of Dupuytren's disease. We suggest that alpha 5 beta 1 integrin, linking fibronectin to stromal cells of both proliferative and involutional phases, may be involved in the contractile processes occurring in Dupuytren's disease.",Acta histochemica,8525780,1995
Correlation of alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and contraction in Dupuytren's disease fibroblasts.,"We studied 11 nodules from patients with Dupuytren's contracture to determine whether alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in Dupuytren's fibroblasts is related to the generation of contractile force. Tissue was placed into explant culture and fibroblast strains were obtained. The mean percent of cultured Dupuytren's fibroblasts expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin, as determined by immunofluorescence, was 14 +/- 8 and ranged from 1% to 26%. The ability of Dupuytren's fibroblasts to generate contractile force was determined by using a previously described collagen lattice contraction assay. We observed a significant positive correlation between the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and the generation of contractile force in cell strains of Dupuytren's fibroblasts. In addition, six fibroblast strains from palmar fascia of individuals undergoing carpal tunnel release were examined. In six strains of palmar fibroblasts the mean percent of cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin was 5 +/- 3 and ranged from 1% to 9%. Six Dupuytren's fibroblast strains, in which more than 15% of the cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin, were significantly more contractile than the palmar fibroblasts. These results suggest that Dupuytren's fibroblasts can acquire smooth muscle characteristics and that the acquisition of a smooth muscle-like phenotype correlates with increased contractility.",The Journal of hand surgery,7642925,1995
The distally-based dorsal hand flap for resurfacing skin defects in Dupuytren's contracture.,Surgery for recurrence of Dupuytren's disease often results in a volar skin defect. The use of the distally-based dorsal hand flap for resurfacing is reported. 17 flaps were used to cover 16 fingers after radical digital fasciectomy. All flaps survived with minor areas of partial necrosis in four of them. The raising of the flap was a simple procedure and good quality skin cover was achieved. There were no complaints about the donor site or the flap pedicle passing between the digits. The short post-operative immobilization time might result in less stiffness and a better functional result. It is concluded that the flap is a useful technique in treating skin defects in this condition resulting from surgical excision of the disease and involved skin.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7759920,1995
"Biomechanical properties of normal tendons, normal palmar aponeuroses and palmar aponeuroses from patients with Dupuytren's disease subjected to elastase and chondroitinase treatment.","Normal tendons, normal palmar aponeuroses and specimens from patients with Dupuytren's disease, namely apparently normal palmar aponeuroses and contracture bands were subjected to elastase and chondroitinase ABC digestion. Maximum Young's modulus, normalized hysteresis loop and residual elongation were determined before and after enzyme treatment. In normal tendons, normal and apparently normal palmar aponeuroses both normalized hysteresis loop and residual elongation increased significantly after elastase treatment, whereas the stiffness decreased. Normalized hysteresis loop and residual elongation display changes corresponding to the amount of digested elastin. The increased viscosity of untreated contracture bands containing less elastin, as compared to normal palmar aponeurosis, was not affected by elastase. Obviously, the elastic fibers in normal shape and distribution are responsible for maintaining an elastic status with a low viscous stress component. With the exception of contracture bands chondroitinase ABC caused a minor increase of residual elongation and as opposed to elastase a decrease of normalized hysteresis loop indicating an increased mobility of the tissue fibers.",Connective tissue research,15612326,1995
A modified open palm technique for Dupuytren's disease. Short and long term results in 54 patients.,"Fifty-four patients with Dupuytren's disease were operated on using transverse and Bruner incisions, leaving the transverse palmar and digital wounds open. The mean follow up was 6.6 years (minimum 5 years). The mean percentage correction of the overall fixed flexion deformity was 71%. The incidence of recurrence and extension of the disease were similar to other series of limited aponeurectomy. However, the postoperative complications were very much lower and the method is particularly suitable for patients over 50 years of age.",International orthopaedics,8567134,1995
[Dupuytren contracture--current status in research and clinical practice].,"Dupuytren's contracture is a disease of the connective tissue, especially of the palmar side of the hand. Today, by means of electron microscopy and histochemistry, several alternations specific of pathology of the disease can be shown, providing a better understanding. However, a revolutionary change of treatment is far out of reach. Dupuytren's diathesis can be influenced by none of today's known methods, and therapy is still empirical. Operative therapy is only indicated in functional impairment. Treatment should be done by well-trained surgeons and in case of extensive diathesis by carefully planning and longtime follow-up to avoid complications and eruption of the disease.",Therapeutische Umschau.

The expression of platelet-derived growth-factor gene in Dupuytren contracture.,"Dupuytren contracture is a disease of the palmar fascia characterized by nodular fibroblastic proliferation; its etiology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. Growth factors are polypeptides that regulate cell growth and differentiation and extracellular matrix production. Platelet-derived growth factor is known to cause fibroblastic proliferation, and it may be involved in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren contracture. The purpose of this study was to determine if the gene for the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor is expressed in Dupuytren contracture. Tissue from patients who had Dupuytren disease was examined immunohistochemically with the 5B5 antibody, which is a marker for fibroblasts. Polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting, and in situ hybridization were also used to study gene expression in the tissue as well as in normal fascia, A172 cells, and MRC5 cells. Total cellular RNA was extracted from tissue and cells. Polymerase chain reaction was done with oligonucleotide primers complementary to a portion of the platelet-derived growth-factor-B and platelet-derived growth-factor-receptor genes. The platelet-derived growth-factor-B gene was expressed in all six specimens from the patients who had Dupuytren contracture as well as in the A172 cells, but not in the normal fascia lata or the MRC5 cells. These results were confirmed with Southern blotting of the products of the reaction with a platelet-derived growth-factor-B probe. The gene for the platelet-derived growth-factor receptor was expressed by all tissues and cells studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

"Dupuytren's disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, and diabetes mellitus.","A comparative prospective study of 120 adult diabetics (60 insulin dependent, 60 non-insulin dependent) and 120 non-diabetic adults as controls showed significantly higher incidence of Dupuytren's disease, limited joint motion, carpal tunnel syndrome, and flexor tenosynovitis in the diabetic population. Of the diabetic patients one third had a mild non-progressive form of Dupuytren's disease, which commonly involved the long and ring rays. Limited joint motion was noted in a third of diabetics, and carpal tunnel syndrome was observed in 15-25%, and flexor tenosynovitis in about a fifth. Limited joint motion co-existed with Dupuytren's disease in 57% of insulin-dependent diabetics. Diabetic polyneuropathy was found in two thirds of insulin-dependent diabetics and in one third of non-insulin dependent diabetics. All these hand changes were more marked in insulin-dependent diabetics and they showed a positive correlation with increasing age of the patient, duration of the diabetes, and the presence of a microangiopathy.",The Journal of hand surgery,7722249,1995
Transforming growth factor-beta: possible roles in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional polypeptide that stimulates extracellular matrix deposition and fibroblast proliferation. Because both these features characterize Dupuytren's contracture, we investigated a possible role for TGF-beta in the etiology of this disorder. We studied receptor expression for TGF-beta, effects of TGF-beta 1 on DNA-synthesis, and in vitro production of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 in both normal and Dupuytren-derived fibroblasts. We also studied the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on growth of the different cell types. TGF-beta receptor profiles were different between the two cell types, as were TGF-beta 1 and EGF-induced stimulation of cell growth. Both cell types secreted both active and latent TGF-beta. Our results suggest that growth factors such as TGF-beta and EGF may play a role in Dupuytren's contracture.",The Journal of hand surgery,7722248,1995

Expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms in mammary epithelial cells and in myofibroblasts from different fibrotic settings during neoplasia.,"The expression of smooth muscle (SM) and non-muscle (NM) myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms has been studied in fibroblastic cells of different fibrotic lesions (hypertrophic scars, Dupuytren's nodules and stromal reaction to mammary carcinoma) and in epithelial cells of non-neoplastic and neoplastic mammary glands, using anti-myosin antibodies in immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Two antibodies were specific for SM-MyHC isoforms (SM1 and SM2) and three antibodies were directed against different sequences of NM-MyHC isoforms. Myofibroblasts containing SM-MyHC were present in a variable number of cases of the different lesions: 1 of 11 hypertrophic scars, 3 of 9 Dupuytren's nodules and 20 of 25 breast cancers. The distribution of NM-MyHC sequences recognized by our antibodies was heterogeneous in fibroblasts from normal dermis and mammary stroma, but became homogeneous in myofibroblasts from all the pathological conditions examined. Moreover, the expression of these MyHC sequences differed in normal mammary epithelium when compared with invasive carcinoma. These results show that cellular modulation from fibroblast to myofibroblast may be accompanied by the appearance of SM-MyHC and is characterized by a uniform expression of MyHC of NM type, and that tumour progression in mammary epithelial cells may be paralleled by the disappearance of a specific NM-MyHC sequence. This suggests that MyHC modulation participates in the process of fibrosis as well as in the process of malignant epithelial transformation.",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,7535633,1995
Increased prevalence of soft tissue hand lesions in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus: various entities and associated significance.,"Sixty Type 1 (insulin dependent) and sixty Type 2 (non insulin dependent) diabetic patients attending a diabetology unit were examined in search of limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's disease, flexor tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome, in comparison with two populations of 60 non diabetic controls matched for sex and age with the Type 1 and the Type 2 diabetic patients. Microangiopathic and neuropathic complications, glycaemic control, blood pressure and tobacco consumption were simultaneously assessed in 39 of the 60 type 1 and in all the type 2 diabetic patients. The prevalence of the various soft tissue hand lesions was higher in both diabetic populations (respectively Type 1 and Type 2) than in their control populations: Limited joint mobility: 33.3 and 26.7% vs 5.0 and 8.3% (both p &lt; 0.01); Dupuytren's disease: 35.0 and 30.0% vs 6.7 and 10.0% (both p &lt; 0.01); flexor tenosynovitis: 23.3 and 16.7% vs 0.0 and 3.3% (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05); carpal tunnel syndrome: 26.7 and 15.0% vs 3.3 and 5% (p &lt; 0.01 and NS). The prevalence of limited joint mobility in Type 1 diabetes was independently associated with increasing age (p &lt; 0.05) and to lower extent with increasing duration of diabetes (p = 0.05), whereas the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease only correlated with increasing age in both types of diabetes (p &lt; 0.05). In Type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of flexor tenosynovitis also increased independently with age (p &lt; 0.05), and the prevalence of limited joint mobility increased in the opposite way to the body mass index after adjustment on age, duration of diabetes and sex (p &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Diabete &amp; metabolisme,7713273,1994
Generation of contractile force by cultured Dupuytren's disease and normal palmar fibroblasts.,"Contractile fibroblasts are believed to be responsible for palmar fascia contracture in Dupuytren's Disease. An in vitro collagen lattice model was used to examine the contractile properties of Dupuytren's fibroblasts from 10 patients undergoing partial fasciectomy, and palmar fascia fibroblasts from 6 patients undergoing carpel tunnel release. Dupuytren's and palmar fascia fibroblasts cultured within a stabilized collagen lattice acquired morphological characteristics similar to those of 'myofibroblasts' in Dupuytren's diseased fascia. Both types of fibroblasts generated contractile forces that resulted in rapid collagen lattice contraction after release of the lattice from points of stabilization. Generation of contractile force by the fibroblasts was inhibited by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, lack of cells, or serum removal. Afferent neuropeptides (substance P, galanin and neurokinin A) did not promote lattice contraction. These results demonstrate that normal palmar fascia fibroblasts can modulate into Dupuytren's-like fibroblasts and that cultured fibroblasts, from either Dupuytren's diseased or normal palmar fascia, can generate contractile forces that are transmitted to extracellular matrix. In addition, fibroblast contraction is an actin based process which requires specific factor(s) present in serum. It is suggested that in Dupuytren's disease extracellular cues trigger the modulation of fibroblasts to Dupuytren's fibroblasts and the promotion of contractile forces responsible for palmar fascia contrature.",Tissue &amp; cell,9437248,1994
Predictors of neurovascular displacement in hands with Dupuytren's contracture.,"A prospective study of hands with Dupuytren's contracture was designed to test the association of three variables, the presence of an interdigital soft tissue mass, the presence of flexion contractures at each digital joint, and the duration of contracture, with the formation of spiral nerves. 66 digits in 37 hands affected by Dupuytren's disease were examined intra-operatively. Of the 34 digits (52%) with spiral nerves, 28 had soft tissue masses (42%). The sensitivity of a soft tissue mass alone as a predictor of a spiral nerve was 59% and the specificity 75%. The presence of a flexion contracture at the PIP joint had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 62% for the presence of a spiral nerve. The combination of a soft tissue mass and a PIP joint contracture was a very specific (94%) but not a particularly sensitive (50%) test for spiral nerve formation. The formation of a spiral nerve is progressive, occurring most often in hands with significant PIP joint contractures with or without soft tissue interdigital masses.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7822934,1994
Long term follow-up of dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture.,"During the 4-year period 1980-1983, we carried out 338 operations for Dupuytren's disease of the hand. Of these 46 (13.6%) had a dermofasciectomy and skin graft for recurrent disease. In this sub-group, 34 patients (10.1%) were operated on by the same senior surgeon (H.G.B.). Only these cases were included in this study. Average follow-up was 100 months (range 80-120 months). It was found that graft durability was good, there was no clinical evidence of recurrence beneath grafts, contracture did not exceed 15 degrees at any joint and two point discrimination in the graft was equal to, or better than, 12 mm in the palm and 8 mm in the digit.",British journal of plastic surgery,7952813,1994
Hand-arm vibration syndrome and dose-response relation for vibration induced white finger among quarry drillers and stonecarvers. Italian Study Group on Physical Hazards in the Stone Industry.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence of disorders associated with the hand arm vibration syndrome in a large population of stone workers in Italy. The dose-response relation for vibration induced white finger (VWF) was also studied.METHODS: The study population consisted of 570 quarry drillers and stonecarvers exposed to vibration and 258 control stone workers who performed only manual activity. Each subject was interviewed with health and workplace assessment questionnaires. Sensorineural and VWF disorders were staged according to the Stockholm workshop scales. Vibration was measured on a representative sample of percussive and rotary tools. The 8 h energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration (A (8)) and lifetime vibration doses were calculated for each of the exposed stone workers.RESULTS: Sensorineural and musculoskeletal symptoms occurred more frequently in the workers exposed to vibration than in the controls, but trend statistics did not show a linear exposure-response relation for these disorders. The prevalence of VWF was found to be 30.2% in the entire group exposed to vibration. Raynaud's phenomenon was discovered in 4.3% of the controls. VWF was strongly associated with exposure to vibration and a monotonic dose-response relation was found. According to the exposure data of this study, the expected percentage of stone workers affected with VWF tends to increase roughly in proportion to the square root of A(8) (for a particular exposure period) or in proportion to the square root of the duration of exposure (for a constant magnitude of vibration).CONCLUSION: Even although limited to a specific work situation, the dose-response relation for VWF estimated in this study suggests a time dependency such that halving the years of exposure allows a doubling of the energy equivalent vibration. According to these findings, the vibration exposure levels currently under discussion within the European Community seem to represent reasonable exposure limits for the protection of workers against the harmful effects of hand transmitted vibration.",Occupational and environmental medicine,7951792,1994
Central slip attenuation in Dupuytren's contracture: a cause of persistent flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint.,"This paper stresses the importance of central slip attenuation in the management of Dupuytren's contracture. Such attenuation occurs in patients who have had prolonged proximal interphalangeal joint contractures and is a common problem when the flexion contracture exceeds 60 degrees. The diagnosis can be made at the time of surgical correction by a tenodesis test. If central slip attenuation is confirmed, the postoperative regime described here will give a better correction of what at first might appear to be an intractable proximal interphalangeal joint flexion deformity.",The Journal of hand surgery,7806815,1994
The use of skeletal traction to correct the flexed PIP joint in Dupuytren's disease. A pilot study to assess the use of the Pipster.,"The flexed PIP joint presents a particular problem in the treatment of advanced Dupuytren's disease. Following reports of the use of skeletal traction in the treatment of this condition, a simple device, the &quot;Pipster&quot; was developed to extend the PIP joint by skeletal traction before surgery. In seven fingers in five patients with severe contractures, there was a pre-operative improvement of at least 45 degrees in the flexion angle (measured as maximum achievable passive extension). The technique was effective in primary and recurrent disease. Subsequent surgery was facilitated and amputation avoided in five fingers. The optimum distraction technique was identified. The study continues with more patients.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7964109,1994
The palmar fascia after treatment by the continuous extension technique for Dupuytren's contracture.,"After complete elongation using the continuous extension technique the palmar fascia of four patients with Dupuytren's contracture was examined by light and electron microscopy and compared with non-elongated samples from 20 patients at the same clinical stage of the disease. Nodules and cords were no longer clinically recognizable after extension. The tissue contained collagen fibrils of uniform diameter (about 50 nm), densely packed in fibres parallel to the stretching force. Fine filaments (presumably proteoglycans) formed a network which was intermingled with and periodically bound to the collagen fibrils. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with an high biosynthetic activity and oxytalan-like microfibrils were aligned along the collagen fibres. The results show that in Dupuytren's disease the contracted palmar fascia reacts to external forces with neoformation and reorientation of all tissue components by myofibroblasts.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7964108,1994
The continuous elongation technique for severe Dupuytren's disease. A biochemical mechanism.,"Continuous extension of Dupuytren's contracture prior to fasciectomy results in a softening of the tissue, allowing straightening of the fingers. The observed change in cross-link profile indicates an increase in newly synthesised collagen due to increased turnover. This was confirmed by demonstration of the increases in levels of the degradative enzymes, the neutral metalloproteinases, collagenase and gelatinase and the acidic cathepsins B and L. Both types of enzyme effectively depolymerize the collagen fibres, albeit by different mechanisms, leading initially to loss of tensile strength and ultimately to solubilization. We suggest that the increase in enzyme activity is generated by tension on the fibroblasts of this metabolically active tissue produced during the continuous extension of the retracted fingers. The weakening of the fibres by degradation and the increase in newly synthesized collagen provide an explanation for the extension of the tissue without trauma.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7964107,1994
Prolonged epidural anaesthesia in a patient with Dupuytren's diathesis.,A patient with Dupuytren's diathesis experienced a prolonged sensory and motor block following epidural anaesthesia.

Dupuytren's contracture: report of a Taiwanese case.,"This case of Dupuytren's contracture was seen in a 65-year-old Taiwanese male farmer patient. The patient complained of a progressive inability to fully extend the ring and middle fingers of his dominant hand over the last three years. Clinically, a longitudinal cord-like mass surrounded the distal palmar crease of the hand and digital flexion contraction of the ring finger was more affected than the middle finger. Histopathologically, the excised tissue was of a mixed, moderate and scantily cellular type. After surgical treatment by limited fasciectomy, the patient's hand recovered fully. No recurrent contracture was noted after three years of follow-up.",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,7858460,1994
[The factors promoting dystrophic pathology of the hand and duodenal peptic ulcer in women].,"The authors have made an attempt to make exact the reasons of the frequent association of hand dystrophic pathology and duodenal ulceration disease in women. It is revealed that pointed diseases are to be the late symptoms of equally directed alterations in the organism, including neuro-humoral and immune mechanisms of adaptation, occurring in women even in sexual maturing period and being the favourable background for occurrence of various diseases including hand dystrophic pathology and duodenal ulcerative disease.",Vestnik khirurgii imeni I.

Dupuytren's contracture in the black population: a review.,"There is general agreement that Dupuytren's contracture is a genetic disorder that occurs predominantly in white men of Northern European ancestry. It appears rarely in the purely black population. We present our experience from Temple University of 8 black patients with Dupuytren's contracture. We also present a review of the world literature dealing with the black population and Dupuytren's disease. A total of 23 patients are reviewed, including our group. They all fall into the category of no Caucasian admixture and negative family history of Dupuytren's contracture. Every patient reviewed has at least 1 hand involved. History and presentation of disease, as well as epidemiological associations (e.g., age distribution, diabetes, and epilepsy), in our review are similar to that seen in the Caucasian population. The diathesis or predisposition for Dupuytren's contracture appears to be less extensive in our series of 8 black patients. History taking, with regard to occupation and possible traumatic etiology, remains a very useful tool.",Annals of plastic surgery,8074370,1994
Prevalence of HLA-DR3 and autoantibodies to connective tissue components in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Forty-six patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and 55 control persons were HLA-typed for class I and HLA-DR class II antigens and were investigated for the presence of autoantibodies against elastin (ELAB) and collagen types I-IV (ACA I-IV). Using the chi 2 test, obtained from 2 x 2 contingency tables, a significant association was found between DC and HLA-DR3 and autoantibodies to types I-IV collagen. ELAB and ACA I and III were significantly correlated with HLA-DR3 in the whole group of patients plus controls. In analogy to other diseases with autoimmunologic features the presence of HLA-DR3 therefore seems to indicate a higher risk for the formation of connective tissue autoantibodies. The remodeling processes during the course of fibrosis in DC might be responsible for this autoantibody formation.",Clinical immunology and immunopathology,8181183,1994
Effect of gamma-interferon on the clinical and biologic evolution of hypertrophic scars and Dupuytren's disease: an open pilot study.,"Hypertrophic scars and Dupuytren's disease are characterized by the presence of modified fibroblasts or myofibroblasts which are allegedly responsible for tissue retraction and excessive connective tissue production. gamma-Interferon, a cytokine produced by T-helper lymphocytes, has been shown to decrease fibroblast replication, alpha-smooth-muscle actin (the actin isoform characterizing myofibroblasts) expression, and collagen production. We have investigated in an open pilot study the possibility that intralesional injections of gamma-interferon exert a beneficial effect on the evolution of hypertrophic scars and Dupuytren's disease. In the 14 selected patients, gamma-interferon decreased the symptoms and the size of the lesions of both diseases; in hypertrophic scars, immunofluorescence examination showed that alpha-smooth-muscle actin expression also was decreased in myofibroblasts. Moreover, in fibroblasts cultured from 4 patients with hypertrophic scars, gamma-interferon decreased replication and alpha-smooth-muscle actin expression in vitro. Our results suggest that gamma-interferon could represent a useful adjunct to the nonsurgical therapy of hypertrophic scars and Dupuytren's disease. Larger controlled clinical studies, however, should test the validity of these preliminary observations.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,8171142,1994
Comparative effects of growth factors on fibroblasts of Dupuytren's tissue and normal palmar fascia.,"Recent experimental evidence implicates various growth factors in the pathophysiology of Dupuytren's disease. This study describes a technique to produce an in vitro cell culture system from both normal palmar fascia and Dupuytren's fascia. The cells were separately exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), after which the effects of these growth factors on proliferation rate and collagen production were determined. Basic FGF and PDGF were found to be mitogenic for both cell types, and TGF-beta was a potent stimulator of collagen production for both cell types. There were quantitative and qualitative differences between the cell types, with Dupuytren cells being more metabolically active and more sensitive to the growth factors tested. We present a theoretical model based on previous investigations and incorporating the contribution of growth factors as it relates to the pathophysiology of Dupuytren's disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,8056971,1994
Distribution of ED-A and ED-B containing fibronectin isoforms in Dupuytren's disease.,"Different fibronectin (FN) isoforms arise via alternate splicing of a single gene transcript in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. Antibodies were used to evaluate the presence and distribution of FN and its isoforms in Dupuytren's diseased and normal palmar fascia. Immunolocalization studies show extracellular FN fibrils, including FN isoforms containing extra domains A (A-FN) and B (B-FN), in proliferative and involutional stage Dupuytren's diseased tissue. However, B-FN appears less abundant and more restricted in its distribution as compared to A-FN or total FN. Total FN and A-FN are significantly reduced in residual tissue, while B-FN is not present. A-FN and B-FN are not present in normal palmar fascia, while total FN staining is slight and restricted to the loose connective tissue surrounding the large, parallel bundles of collagen fibers. The presence of A-FN and B-FN in Dupuytren's diseased palmar fascia represents a disease-induced appearance of these FN isoforms and further evidence of an association between Dupuytren's disease and wound healing.",The Journal of hand surgery,8056970,1994

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy associated with antiepileptic drugs.,"Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) complicating antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy is not well acknowledged in the neurologic literature. We report 4 patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy that occurred while they were receiving AEDs. All patients had shoulder and hand involvement, which in 2 was bilateral, and 1 had ipsilateral foot involvement. Two patients did not respond to a change in AEDs, but all improved with a course of prednisone. One patient with phenobarbital (PB)-associated RSDS relapsed on inadvertent rechallenge with secobarbital. A review of the literature showed that several other fibrosing disorders are associated with AED administration, including Dupuytren's contractures, frozen shoulder, plantar and hand nodules, and Peyronie's disease. RSD associated with AEDs is important to recognize because it may result in permanent disability if treatment is delayed.",Epilepsia,8156963,1994
HLA antigens in Peyronie's disease.,"This study presents data on HLA phenotypes of 52 unrelated patients suffering from idiopathic Peyronie's disease. This first investigation on HLA class II antigens detected an association of HLA-DR3 and -DQw2 in this disorder. HLA typing was done from ACD-stabilized peripheral blood using the modified lymphocytotoxicity test. Antigen frequencies of the patient group were compared with those of healthy individuals of the local population. There were no deviations of frequencies for antigens of the B7 cross-reacting group as described in earlier studies. In addition none of the other class I antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C) showed any significant deviation in frequencies after correction of p values. Regarding class II antigens HLA-DR3 was detected in the patient group in 33.3% compared with 16.0% of the control population (corrected p &lt; 0.05). The closely linked antigen DQw2 was found in 58.8 compared with 31.2% (corrected p &lt; 0.005). Not only genetic factors can be stated by these findings. As HLA-DR3 and -DQw2 are known to be the typical associated antigens of organospecific autoimmune disorders, this suggests possible autoimmunological factors in this disorder of otherwise unknown etiology.",Urologia internationalis,8140677,1994
The open palm technique in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Twenty-eight patients (33 hands) were reviewed an average 2.5 years after an open palm technique combined with partial fasciectomy for the correction of Dupuytren's disease. They were assessed by diathesis evaluation and Tubiana's score. Results show a recurrence rate of 33.5% (3% severe), an extension rate of 51.5% and an overall complication rate of 21% without reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Fifteen percent and 12% had an important deficit in flexion and extension respectively. These findings are comparable to those found in the literature.",Acta orthopaedica Belgica,7847092,1994
"Appearance of the myofibroblastic phenotype in Dupuytren's disease is associated with a fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV and tenascin extracellular matrix.","The proliferative nodules of Dupuytren's disease are electron microscopically characterized by the occurrence of myofibroblasts with a basal lamina-like material. As reported in the literature, immunohistochemical investigations showed a fibronectin matrix but failed to demonstrate laminin. This discrepancy between electron microscopic features and immunohistochemical findings prompted us to examine the composition of extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV and tenascin) in relation to the myofibroblast phenotype in proliferative nodules from 13 native surgical specimens of nodular palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's disease). The immunohistochemical staining for fibronectin was positive within the whole palmar aponeurosis and was particularly intense in the proliferative areas, whereas laminin, collagen type IV and tenascin labelling was restricted to the alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive proliferative nodules. To exclude definitively an unspecific laminin labelling, SDS-PAGE and immunoblot were performed. The electrophoretic pattern of Dupuytren's disease tissue revealed laminin and was in congruence with human placental tissue used as positive control. The results substantiate an extracellular matrix formation by myofibroblasts with fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV and tenascin as constituents. Therefore, laminin expression can no longer be considered to be a distinguishing feature between myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.","Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",7524526,1994

Twenty-nine dermo-fasciectomies were performed on the palmar area of the fifth finger. The improvement in the MP joint was complete in all cases. A classification in to 4 grades according to the degree of pre- and postoperative retraction is proposed. The average improvement at the PIP joint was 50 degrees. 26 recurrences were observed. The recurrence rate was similar with or without a skin graft but the functional result was better with a digital graft, as recurrences were located away from the PIP joint.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,7521655,1994
Amputations in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"23 finger amputations in 19 patients operated on for Dupuytren's disease were reviewed 6 months to 8.5 years after operation (mean 4 years). The distribution of amputations were 17 little fingers and six ring fingers. We found a recurrent lack of extension in nine out of 16 finger amputations distal to the MP joint and painful neuroma or phantom limb pain in five out of seven little finger amputations through or proximal to the MP joint. When amputation in the little finger is necessary, disarticulation of the MP joint may be preferable to amputation at a more distal level. Alternatives to finger amputation should be sought in difficult cases of Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8308443,1993
[Non-surgical treatment of Dupuytren disease using needle fasciotomy].,"Short-term and five-year outcomes after nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by needle fasciotomy were studied. Among the 138 patients who were evaluated, 90 (123 hands) were seen five years after the procedure. Outcome was excellent or good in 81% of cases in the short term and 69% of cases after 5 years. Adverse events included skin breaks (20 hands, 16% of cases), digital dysesthesia due to nerve damage (3 patients, 2% of cases), and local infection (3 patients, 2% of cases). Five-year recurrence rate was 50.4%. These findings demonstrate the value of needle fasciotomy especially in the early stages of Dupuytren's disease.",Revue du rhumatisme (Ed. francaise : 1993),8054928,1993
The presence of myofibroblasts in the dermis of patients with Dupuytren's contracture. A possible source for recurrence.,"Samples of skin and underlying cord obtained at dermofasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture have been examined for the presence of smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM alpha-actin), a marker for myofibroblasts. 15 of the 20 samples stained positively for SM alpha-actin corresponding with areas of hypercellular Dupuytren's tissue. In 12 of these 15 samples SM alpha-actin-positive hypercellular Dupuytren's tissue extended into the dermis, in three cases reaching the epidermis. In eight samples, diffusely distributed cells positive for SM alpha-actin and resembling fibroblasts were seen in the dermis. These cells appeared to be separate from the Dupuytren's foci. The presence of hypercellular foci and isolated fibroblasts positive for SM alpha-actin within the dermis may explain the high recurrence rate of Dupuytren's disease after fasciectomy.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8294839,1993
Dermal dendrocytes in Dupuytren's disease: a link between the skin and pathogenesis?,"The skin has previously been implicated in the process of Dupuytren's disease. The dermal dendrocyte is a factor XIIIa positive cell, which has been found in normal skin and some pathological conditions associated with fibrosis. In this study we examined the distribution of factor XIIIa positive cells in and around tissue from Dupuytren's disease. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a panel of antibodies for factor XIIIa, macrophages (CD68 and MAC387) and MHC II. Many factor XIIIa positive dendritic cells were present in and around Dupuytren's tissue; fewer CD68 and MHC II positive cells and very few MAC387 cells were seen. We propose that the factor XIIIa positive cells are dermal dendrocytes. This study may indicate an important link between the skin and pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",7905015,1993

Hand abnormalities are strongly associated with the duration of diabetes mellitus.,"OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of hand abnormalities in diabetic patients and to evaluate associations between the hand abnormalities and diabetic variables, ergonomic factors and smoking habits.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 100 patients selected at random. Setting. Out-patient clinic, Department of Internal Medicine, Orebro Medical Centre Hospital in Sweden.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence and extent of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), Dupuytren's contracture (DC), flexor tenosynovitis (FTS), and limited joint mobility (LJM). Duration of diabetes, metabolic control, chronic diabetic complications, blood pressure, ergonomic factors and smoking habits.RESULTS: Carpal tunnel syndrome, DC, FTS and LJM were each present in about 20% of the patients. Hand abnormalities were observed in 50 patients and more than one abnormality was found in 26 of the patients. The hand abnormalities were associated with the duration of diabetes but not with the metabolic control or with other diabetic complications. However, the diabetic complications were associated with bad metabolic control and with the duration of diabetes. Hand abnormalities correlated with heavy manual work but not with smoking habits. Twenty-five of the 50 patients with hand syndromes were disabled to such an extent that surgery was recommended.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hand abnormalities in diabetic patients is high and increases with the duration of diabetes. In many cases patients with hand abnormalities can be helped by surgery.",Journal of internal medicine,8340742,1993
The continuous elongation treatment by the TEC device for severe Dupuytren's contracture of the fingers.,"The continuous elongation technique is a preparatory step for excision of the pathologic palmar fascia for severe Dupuytren's contracture of the hands. It consists of a physiologic, painless, and atraumatic elongation that is obtained by means of a device fixed on the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones by two self-drilling pins. This paper presents our experience since 1986 with the TEC device, which we designed and built for severe hand contracture; the device has been applied on 56 hands and 85 fingers seriously flexed by Dupuytren's contracture. This advanced methodology also represents a real alternative to the surgical indication of finger amputation in progressive cases of the fascia retraction, and it avoids the necrosis, loss of vascularity, and bad functional results frequently seen after classical operations. The TEC device also avoids the plastic surgical correction of digital or palmar skin loss, particularly when there is a need for a flap or a skin graft. Dupuytren's contracture was for 160 years thought to be degenerative, progressive, and irreversible, but the TEC device, by bringing the contracture back to the initial stage of the disease, opens up new basic research into morphologic and biochemical processes of the collagen in the retracted palmar fascia.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,8516411,1993
T-cell-mediated response in Dupuytren's disease.,"The cause of Dupuytren's disease is unknown, but inflammatory cells might have a role. Enzymatic digestion of diseased tissue permits identification and immunofluorescent labelling of a cell subset displaying inflammatory cell morphology. Cytofluorimetry of this cell population demonstrated the presence of CD3-positive lymphocytes and expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins. These results raise the possibility that Dupuytren's disease is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorder. The development of medical treatment on this basis may reduce the need for surgery, with its associated morbidity and high recurrence rates.","Lancet (London, England)",8099992,1993

Capsular tissues of the proximal interphalangeal joint: normal composition and effects of Dupuytren's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.,"Three fibrocartilages associated with the proximal interphalangeal joint are described--at the attachment of the central slip to bone, within the slip where it passes over the joint, and the volar plate. Material was obtained at surgery following trauma, Dupuytren's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The fibrocartilages were structurally distinct and immunolabelled differently with monoclonal antibodies to extracellular matrix components. All fibrocartilages from normal and Dupuytren's fingers contained chondroitin and keratan sulphate. Type II collagen was present in all attachment zones, although there was little in rheumatoid fingers. It was also present in the dorsal hood of some normal fingers, but not in pathological specimens or the volar plate. The results show that the fibrocartilages are dynamic tissues whose composition varies according to function and use, and changes in disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8345272,1993
Dupuytren's disease in identical twins.,"The aetiology of Dupuytren's disease remains unknown, although hereditary and environmental influences have been implicated. Previous reports have suggested that identical twins will develop identical contractures.

Dupuytren's contracture in black Zimbabweans.,"Four cases of Dupuytren's contracture treated at Mpilo Central Hospital over the last 13 years are presented. Three of these patients were men aged 45, 59 and 74 years. Only one woman aged 55 years was treated during this period. All the four patients were indigenous Black Zimbabweans. There was some history of trauma to the affected upper limb in all three of the male patients and all of them agreed to being moderate smokers but only two gave a history of drinking alcohol. One of the men had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis. The female patient has been on treatment for epilepsy for more than 10 years. There was no family history of Dupuytren's contracture in any of these patients.

Abnormal growth factor and cytokine expression in Dupuytren's contracture.,"AIM: To analyse patterns of gene expression for peptide regulatory factors in patients with Dupuytren's contracture.METHODS: Tissue samples (palmer fascia) from 12 patients with Dupuytren's contracture and 12 controls were studied using the reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique.RESULTS: Tissue from patients with Dupuytren's contracture expressed a higher percentage of peptide regulatory factors than that of controls: interleukin-1 alpha (83% v 16%; p &lt; 0.01); interleukin-1 beta (66% v 8%; p &lt; 0.01); transforming growth factor beta (75% v 25%; p &lt; 0.02); and basic fibroblast growth factor (66% v 25%; p &lt; 0.05). Platelet derived growth factors alpha and beta were also expressed more commonly (66% v 33% and 25% v 16%, respectively), but these differences were not significant.CONCLUSIONS: The increased prevalence of expression for the above mRNAs in Dupuytren's tissue is relevant as interleukin-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta stimulate the growth of fibroblasts and transforming growth factor beta also enhances production of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. Excessive local release of these peptide regulatory factors may have an important role in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture.",Journal of clinical pathology,8320323,1993
"A clinical, ultrastructural and immunochemical study of Dupuytren's disease.","Aponeurotic tissue from seven normal subjects and from apparently unaffected branches, nodules and cords of 16 Dupuytren's patients were compared. Control tissue was characterized by polymorphous cells, showing cytoplasmic microfilament bundles, numerous pinocytic vesicles, basement membrane-like structures, and a thick coat of interwoven filaments, and by type I- and III-positive heterogeneous collagen fibrils, fibronectin, vitronectin, decorin and proteoglycans. The clinically normal branches consisted of fibroblast-like cells, small type III-highly positive collagen fibrils, fibronectin and proteoglycans. Nodules and fibrotic cords contained fibroblast-like cells, type I and III collagen, fibronectin and proteoglycans. Myofibroblast-like cells in only five out of 16 patients were present. There was no relation between clinical stage and structural alterations; the whole aponeurosis always seemed to be involved; cord retraction would seem to depend on the interactions among fibroblast-like cells and matrix components and among matrix macromolecules themselves.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8501391,1993
A study of the repeatability of the diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture and its prevalence in the grampian region.,"200 consecutive geriatric patients over 60 years of age (100 men and 100 women) were examined for signs of Dupuytren's contracture and questioned about certain risk factors thought to be associated with the disease. Each patient was examined, independently, by two orthopaedic surgeons. The diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture was established by the finding of a thickening in the palm fixed to the palmar fascia as a nodule or band. However each patient was also examined for skin tethering, flexion contractures of digits and knuckle pads. The results were then analysed and a Kappa test performed on the data to assess the inter-observer variability in eliciting the signs of Dupuytren's contracture. Using the Kappa test agreement between the two observers was found to be, on average, 1.0 for observing flexion contractures, 0.8 for observing skin tethering, 0.7 for observing palmar nodules and 0.7 for observing knuckle pads. The two observers both made the diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture in 21% of women and 39% of men. These figures are high compared with previously published data from other centres and confirm the locally held belief that Dupuytren's contracture is particularly prevalent in North-east Scotland.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8501390,1993
Prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture and its correlation with degenerative changes of the hands and feet and with criteria of general health.,"The prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture and its coincidence with degenerative changes in the hands and feet as well as loss of distal pulses, were studied in 574 55-year-old residents of Malmö, Sweden. Dupuytren's contracture occurred in 6% of the subjects studied, predominantly in men. Dupuytren's contracture was more common in men with degenerative changes in the feet and in men with signs of impaired arterial blood flow in the lower limbs. Men with Dupuytren's contracture had significantly less subcutaneous fat tissue, as measured by a triceps skinfold index, than men without Dupuytren's contracture. Other signs of general health, occupational work load or psychosocial factors did not interact with Dupuytren's contracture in the current study.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8501389,1993
Dupuytren's contracture: MR imaging findings and correlation between MR signal intensity and cellularity of lesions.,"OBJECTIVE: Dupuytren's contracture is a common fibrosing disorder of the hand which often results in progressive and debilitating flexion contractures of the fingers. Recurrence after surgical release is common and may be related, in part, to the cellularity of the lesion. We describe the MR appearance of Dupuytren's contracture and correlate signal characteristics with the degree of cellularity of the lesion.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 11 hands in 10 patients were studied. All patients had surgical resection after MR imaging (median interval, 3 days). The surgical and pathologic findings were correlated with the MR findings. The signal characteristics of the lesions were correlated with the histologic findings.RESULTS: We found that MR imaging was accurate for detecting Dupuytren's contracture and depicting its extent. The lesions include subcutaneous nodules, usually at the level of the distal palmar crease, and cords that lie parallel and superficial to the flexor tendons. The cords had a uniformly low signal intensity (similar to the signal intensity of tendon) on both T1- and T2-weighted images in 18 of 22 cases, whereas the remaining four cases had a low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images (a slightly higher signal intensity than that of tendon) and a low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Histologically, the cords were hypocellular and composed of dense collagen. Most nodules had an intermediate signal intensity (similar to that of muscle) on both T1- and T2-weighted images (10 of 13 cases), usually stippled with focal areas of lower signal intensity. Histologically, these nodules were mostly cellular. Three of the nodules had a low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images and were hypocellular histologically.CONCLUSION: We conclude that MR imaging can be used to define palmar involvement in Dupuytren's contracture. The signal characteristics of the lesions correlate with the degree of cellularity of the lesions as seen histologically. The ability to assess preoperatively the cellularity of lesions of Dupuytren's contractures may be of prognostic significance, because highly cellular lesions tend to have higher rates of recurrence after surgery than do hypocellular lesions.",AJR.

Dupuytren's contracture in pensioners at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.,"Dupuytren's disease of the hands was present in 55 (13.75%) of the 400 elderly ex-servicemen living at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Five men (9.1%) reported the condition in either a parent or sibling, but none was aware of an affected child. The prevalence of heavy drinking, non-insulin dependent diabetes or manual occupation was statistically the same in those with or without the condition. Overall, both hands were equally affected, but they differed in severity in 29 men. In milder cases the left hand was the more severely affected (grades 1 and 2); the reverse was true when the difference in severity was greater (grade 3). Since the original description of Dupuytren's disease [1] attempts have been made to link it with a variety of other conditions. These have included trauma, alcoholism and cirrhosis, [2] epilepsy [3] and diabetes mellitus [4]. A genetic link is accepted [5]. The condition is more common in men than women and becomes increasingly common with advancing age [6]. The prevalence in elderly men has been reported as high as 28.9%, rising to 64.3% in surveys of affected families [7]. There are still many physicians who, with a knowing wink when they spot that one of their patients has a Dupuytren's contracture, mentally register that he is an alcoholic. This paper is an attempt to disprove this fairy story. It describes a survey of Dupuytren's disease in a population of elderly men drawn from all parts of the United Kingdom and Ireland.",Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London,8426337,1993
[A familial case of Kennedy's X-linked bulbospinal amyotrophy].,"The authors describe 4 cases of Kennedy's medullo-spinal amyotrophy (BSA) which is a genetically determined disease with mutant gene inheritance by the recessive type with X chromosome cohesion. The disease largely shows up by the impairment of the nervous system in the form of BSA. However, the clinical picture is also marked by the derangement of the mesenchymal (Dupuytren's contracture) and endocrine systems (gynecomastia).",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Intracellular actin as a marker for myofibroblasts in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Myofibroblasts are found in a wide variety of normal tissues and pathological conditions. It is suggested that myofibroblasts are derived from normal fibroblasts and share with smooth muscle cells the expression of actin microfilament bundles. The aim of this study was to establish if the myofibroblast phenotype from tissue expander capsules and Dupuytren's nodules could be distinguished from normal dermal fibroblasts by quantitation of intracellular actin and the ratio of polymerized (filamentous) actin to nonpolymerized (globular) actin.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell lines were established from six patients from each group. In addition to quantitation of intracellular actin, the cells were characterized by criteria of light microscopy, ultrastructure, actin immunofluorescence, and growth rates.RESULTS: Dermal fibroblasts were the smallest and the most spindle-shaped but grew rapidly and had few actin microfilament bundles. By contrast, myofibroblasts from expander capsules were larger and more stellate, proliferated slowly, and had the most prominent microfilament arrays. Cells from Dupuytren's nodules were intermediate in phenotype. Substantial and significant differences in intracellular actin contents were found, ranging from 0.69 +/- 0.05 micrograms/10(4) cells in fibroblasts and 0.77 +/- 0.15 micrograms/10(4) cells for Dupuytren's nodule cells to 1.46 +/- 0.44 micrograms/10(4) cells in expander capsule myofibroblasts (p &lt; 0.05). Similar findings were found with respect to ratios of fibroblast to globular actins, being 0.22 for fibroblasts and 0.38 for Dupuytren's nodule cells compared with 0.70 for expander capsule myofibroblasts (p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of intracellular actin contents and fibroblast:globular actin ratios offers a rapid, sensitive, and reliable technique for establishment of the myofibroblast phenotype and has considerable advantages over traditional ultrastructural approaches for the study of myofibroblast differentiation/regression and in vitro responses to experimental manipulation.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,1460863,1992
Lipids and Dupuytren's disease.,"We studied prospectively the relationship between serum lipids and Dupuytren's disease of the hand in 85 patients, 65 men and 20 women. The Dupuytren patients had significantly higher fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels than did the controls (p &lt; 0.001). The raised levels of serum lipids appeared to be associated with the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease, and this may help to explain the high incidence of Dupuytren's disease in alcoholic, diabetic and epileptic patients, since these conditions are also associated with raised serum lipid levels.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Severe contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease: results of a prospective trial of operative correction and dynamic extension splinting.,"In a prospective study, 23 proximal interphalangeal joints that were severely contracted (&gt; or = 45 degrees) as a result of Dupuytren's disease underwent operative correction and 6 months of dynamic extension splinting. Proximal interphalangeal joint extension was measured preoperatively and postoperatively at 3-month intervals for 1 year and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Mean follow-up was 2 years (minimum, 1 year). Overall, at 2 years, 44% improvement in proximal interphalangeal joint extension was noted. Mean improvement of 59% in proximal interphalangeal joint extension was noted in patients who complied with the postoperative dynamic extension splinting program. Patients who were noncomplaint demonstrated a 25% improvement in proximal interphalangeal joint extension. The difference in values between patients who were compliant and those who were not was statistically significant. Other factors--severity of contracture, digit involved, and the necessity for capsular release--were not significantly related to outcome. This study suggests that soft tissue responds to continuous dynamic extension stresses and can be remodeled over time.",The Journal of hand surgery,1430959,1992
[Dupuytren's disease. Analysis of a 10 year caseload].,"The authors present an analysis concerning patients operated on for Dupuytren contracture over the past ten years. One hundred and ten patients (94 males and 16 females) were reviewed. At the time of surgery the average was 52 years old. The 125 hands (292 fingers) were rated 3,136, according to the simplified Tubiana's score. In 82.7% of the patients, selective regional fasciectomy was applied. In the long term, recurrence appeared in 58 hands (96 fingers); 74.1% being in the first five years. 48 of them were graded Stage Nodular, 28 Stage 1, 16 Stage 2, 4 Stage 3. Some factors seem to be of a bad prognosis regarding recurrence: ectopic localisations, age (under 55 years old), alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and family history. Results after operative procedure were satisfactory. The hands were rated 1,316 and the Coefficient of Amelioration was above 0.75 in more than 50%.",Acta medica portuguesa,1481713,1992
Basic fibroblast growth factor in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Lesions excised from nine patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and three normal fascia were examined for the presence of the angiogenic protein basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF). Endothelial cell proliferation assays established basic FGF-like activity in extracts of DC. Western blotting confirmed the presence of an 18,000-dalton protein which was localized in the lesions by immunohistochemical staining. All of the cells implicated in the progression of the disease (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts) contain the growth factor. Endothelial cells within the narrowed or occluded vessels, as well as fibroblasts surrounding these vessels, stained intensely positive. In situ hybridization using an antisense probe for human basic FGF and its receptor's (FGFR-1) mRNA established the major difference between normal and DC tissues: their levels are significantly higher than in the normal tissues. Thus the cells in DC also express both basic FGF and FGFR-1, suggesting a potential autocrine/paracrine role for basic FGF in the pathogenesis of DC. This finding is thus the first description of a nontumoral proliferative disease that can be directly associated with increased basic FGF mRNA. The possibility that therapies can be developed on the basis that basic FGF and its receptor are expressed in DC is discussed.",The American journal of pathology,1325742,1992
Regression of Dupuytren's contracture.,The phenomenon of clinical regression of Dupuytren's contracture is described and discussed. It is already recognized and used in fasciotomy where it follows the release of longitudinal tension. The quite extraordinary resolution produced by continuous passive skeletal traction in extension is presented. Regression beneath grafted skin is described and discussed with its clinical implications. The generally accepted view of Dupuytren's contracture being &quot;irreversible&quot; now presents a challenge for further clinical and pharmacological studies. The possibility of non-surgical control does exist.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1402277,1992
Vibration white finger and Dupuytren's contracture: are they related?,"Between 1988 and 1990, 500 claimants were assessed and considered to have vibration white finger (VWF). Of these, 137 were under 45 years of age and none had Dupuytren's contracture of the remaining 363, 311 were aged 50-85 years, and of these 62 (19.9 per cent) had Dupuytren's contracture. Statistically, this prevalence was significantly higher than that in a control group of 150 men of similar age distribution (10.7 per cent). As far as can be ascertained, this is the first study to indicate that there may be a causal relationship between VWF and Dupuytren's contracture, and the possible theoretical reasons for this are discussed. It is suggested that further studies are required to confirm or refute the findings.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",1345125,1992
Reversal of digital vasospasm by glyceryl trinitrate patch.,"Localized digital ischaemia following tourniquet deflation is an event producing considerable concern after surgical procedures on the hand, and is more common when severe pre-operative deformity has been radically corrected. We describe three such cases of digital ischaemia, occurring immediately after the release of severe flexion contractures of the digits. Our cases were treated successfully by the application of a proximal cutaneous glyceryl trinitrate patch, which produced prompt recovery of the circulation in the affected digits. We suggest that this simple technique has an important role as theraputically, and possibly also as a diagnostic aid, in the evaluation and management of the post-operative ischaemic digit prior to re-exploration being undertaken.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1624875,1992
The long-term results of enzymic fasciotomy.,"We reviewed ten hands in nine patients who had enzymatic fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture, with an average follow-up of 6.5 years. While all patients were initially satisfied with the results, the disease recurred quite rapidly to pre-operative levels in seven patients over the subsequent two to three years.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1624874,1992
Chromosomal abnormalities in Dupuytren's contracture and carpal tunnel syndrome.,"The cytogenetics of cell cultures derived from Dupuytren's tissue, adjacent palmar fascia and palmar skin from patients undergoing fasciectomy have been examined and the results compared to cell cultures established from palmar fascia, flexor retinaculum and palmar skin of patients undergoing carpal tunnel decompression. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in cell cultures from Dupuytren's tissue in eight of the nine patients studied. Clones of cells trisomic for chromosome 8 were found in five of the nine patients. Trisomy 8 was also present in two of five flexor retinaculum cultures from carpal tunnel syndrome cases. These findings in both Dupuytren's contracture and carpal tunnel syndrome suggest the presence of chromosomal instability in the palmar fascia. The significance of the chromosomal abnormalities is however unclear, but they indicate a possible common pathway in the onset of pathological fibrosis.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1624873,1992
Clinical and cellular effects of colchicine in fibromatosis.,"The proliferating cells in fibromatoses are myofibroblasts that produce abundant stromal collagen and contain intracellular native and widely spaced collagen fibers. To assess the clinical and cellular effects of colchicine in such tumors, this drug was administered to three patients, one with musculoaponeurotic desmoid fibromatosis, one with Dupuytren's palmar fibromatosis, and one with Peyronie's disease. All three patients had an excellent clinical response, with reduction of tumor size and improvement of contracture. Two cases were studied ultrastructurally; the main cellular changes detected were collapse of the rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, reduction of myofilaments, and disappearance of intracellular widely spaced collagen. The findings from this study indicate another probable application for colchicine and support the concept that collagen fibers can be formed intracellularly.",Cancer,1568169,1992
Plantar fibromatosis and bilateral flexion contractures: a review of the literature.,Plantar fibromatosis is a benign multinodular lesion occurring in the plantar fascia. It is generally an asymptomatic lesion or may occasionally cause discomfort or pain in the foot. We present a man who has bilateral flexion contractures of his great toes as a result of his plantar fibromatosis. A review of the literature indicates that this is a very rare presentation of plantar fibromatosis.,Annals of plastic surgery,1622023,1992
An insight into Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a deforming, fibrotic condition of the palmar fascia which has confounded clinicians and scientists since the early descriptions by Guillaume Dupuytren in 1831. It predominantly affects elderly, male caucasians, has a hereditary predisposition and has strong associations with diabetes, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and HIV infection. The major morphological features are an increase in fibroblasts, particularly around narrowed fibroblasts; a finding consistent with localised ischaemia. During ischaemia, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is converted to hypoxanthine and xanthine, and endothelial xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase (alcohol also mediates this change, a finding of particular relevance given the association of Dupuytren's contracture with alcohol intake). Xanthine oxidase catalyses the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and uric acid with the release of superoxide free radicals (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH.). These free radicals are highly reactive, with half-lives in the order of milliseconds and are toxic in high concentrations. A potential for free radical generation in Dupuytren's contracture was elicited by finding a sixfold increase in hypoxanthine concentrations in Dupuytren's contracture compared with control palmar fascia. In vitro studies affirmed the toxic effects of oxygen free radicals to Dupuytren's contracture fibroblasts, but also showed that, at lower concentrations (concentrations similar to those likely to occur in Dupuytren's contracture), free radicals had a stimulatory effect on fibroblast proliferation. Cultured fibroblasts were found to release their own O2-. These endogenously released free radicals were also found to be important in fibroblast proliferation. The collagen changes of Dupuytren's contracture were examined. The results established that fibroblast origin was unimportant, but that inhibition of type I collagen production at high fibroblast density accounted for the increase in type III/I collagen ratios observed by previous investigators. These biochemical and morphological observations throw new light on Dupuytren's contracture. They suggest that age, genetic and environmental factors may contribute to micro vessel narrowing with consequent localised ischaemia and free radical generation. Endothelial xanthine oxidase derived free radicals may both damage the surrounding stroma and stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate. Proliferating fibroblasts lay down and contract collagen in lines of stress.Progressive fibroblast proliferation and deposition of collagen is likely to encourage further microvessel narrowing with a positive feedback effect consistent with the progressive nature of the condition.",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,1616255,1992
[The surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture].,"Treatment of 129 patients with palmar fibromatosis was performed; all the men were from 20 to 63 years old. In 56 patients (1st main group) operation of aponeurectomy was performed with the help of an ultrasonic scalpel (USS), in 53 patients (2nd main group) the operation was made with the help of the microsurgical technique (MST), 30 patients (a control group) were operated upon by usual methods.

Dupuytren's and epilepsy revisited.,"The incidence of Dupuytren's disease amongst the residents of two epileptic centres was found to be 12.0% in one and 38.1% in the other. The overall incidence at the second was significantly higher than a control population (16.0%) and this difference was particularly apparent in patients over 50 years old. The distribution of the Dupuytren's disease was found to be very similar to that of non-epileptic patients. At both centres, the disease process was more severe, with an increased incidence of contractures. Drug therapy was not clearly implicated in the aetiology of this condition.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1588209,1992
The incidence of gout in patients with Dupuytren's disease.,In a retrospective study we found that the incidence of gout in patients with Dupuytren's disease is 3.5%. The mean serum uric acid was 330 mumol/l. (5.5 mg./100 ml.) in men and 240 mumol./l. (4.0 mg./100 ml.) in women. The rate of hyperuricaemia was 7%. These are not significantly higher than the expected figures in Britain.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1588208,1992
The use of a passive motion machine in the postoperative rehabilitation of Dupuytren's disease.,"The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the postoperative use of passive motion (PM) and standard hand therapy after surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease for extent and rate of recovery of joint motion. Our data indicate that metacarpophalangeal joint contractures improved completely to a mean of 0 degrees, regardless of the postoperative protocol. Contractures at the proximal interphalangeal joint showed incomplete recovery in both study groups, with a mean residual contracture of 28 degrees for PM patients and 38 degrees for control patients. Contractures of the metacarpophalangeal-proximal interphalangeal joints in the same finger showed complete metacarpophalangeal joint recovery to a mean of 0 degrees but incomplete proximal interphalangeal joint recovery with a mean residual contracture of 30 degrees in PM patients and 22 degrees in control patients. We conclude that the use of a PM machine in the rehabilitation of Dupuytren's disease does not offer an advantage in the postoperative management of this condition.",The Journal of hand surgery,1564284,1992
Platelet-derived growth factor in Dupuytren's disease.,"This study investigated whether platelet-derived growth factor, a potent inducer of cell proliferation, was identifiable in association with myofibroblasts in Dupuytren's disease. Myofibroblasts in the hypercellular disease stages showed a strong reaction to platelet-derived growth factor antibody using light and electron microscopic immunochemical labels. Platelet-derived growth factor may play a role as a cellular signal for myofibroblast proliferation in the formation of the pathognomonic nodule in Dupuytren's disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,1564283,1992

"Basic fibroblast growth factor in cells derived from Dupuytren's contracture: synthesis, presence, and implications for treatment of the disease.","Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is associated with fibroblast and endothelial cell proliferation. We have identified a fibroblast and endothelial cell mitogen, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), in cells derived from this tissue and characterized the effects of this growth factor on DC cells. Northern blot analysis of DC cells reveals the presence of basic FGF mRNA species, and the DC cells coexpress multiple forms of basic FGF. Radioreceptor assays establish that the DC cells have high-affinity binding sites for basic FGF and proliferate in response to exogenous recombinant basic FGF. Furthermore, a conjugate between saporin (a ribosome-inactivating protein) and basic FGF, which is cytotoxic to cells possessing the basic FGF receptor, is also cytotoxic to DC cells. The possibility that basic FGF-saporin could be a potential therapeutic agent for prevention of recurrence of the disease after surgery is discussed.",The Journal of hand surgery,1314273,1992
"The association between alcohol, hepatic pathology and Dupuytren's disease.","We have looked at the incidence of Dupuytren's disease in alcoholics, those with non-alcoholic liver disease and a control population. Both alcoholic patients and those with non-alcohol related liver disease had a higher rate (28% and 22% respectively) than the controls (8%), but this did not quite reach statistical significance (p greater than 0.05). In addition we found no Dupuytren's disease in 50 Egyptian patients with bilharzia and no consistent biochemical abnormalities in 134 patients with significant Dupuytren's disease. We conclude that alcoholics probably do have a higher rate of Dupuytren's disease and that this effect is largely due to the liver disease caused by alcohol abuse, but that the genetic factors are of greater aetiological importance.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1640149,1992
Rotation of a skin flap from the side of the finger to the volar surface in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"The authors illustrate the technique of rotation of a skin flap from the side of a finger in the treatment of severe Dupuytren's disease especially when localized in the fourth or fifth ray.

NA,"From 1974 to 1988, 868 open palm and/or finger operations were carried out by a surgeon at the SOS Main emergent hand surgery unit in Strasbourg. Out of these, 107 patients making up 140 fingers were seen again after a period of more than 5 years. The essential advantage of the method is the low rate of postoperative complications relative to the other methods involving skin closure. All patients had an ambulatory treatment with regional anesthesia. The palm was opened in 85% of cases, and both the palm and the base of the fingers in 14%. The average healing time was 26 days, with an average sick leave of 28 days. Postoperative pain was noted in 20% of cases, requiring medication in 10% for an average of 3 days. Postoperative bleeding requiring new dressing occurred in one case, after the patient had already been discharged (0.7%), while 3.5% of all patients had anticoagulants. No hematoma and no flap necrosis were noted, and temporary dysesthesia was noted in 4.6% of cases, nerve involvement in 3.1%, and neurovascular dystrophy in 7%, including 4 only with a functional deficit (2.8%). On the other hand, results after 5-6 years are similar to those of selective aponeurectomies published in the literature, with frequent recurrence (40.6%, including 23% severe enough to require second surgery). Extension was noted in 39% of all cases, and the total activity of the disease was present in 55% of all studied hands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Chirurgie; memoires de l'Academie de chirurgie,1339728,1992

Dermofasciectomy: a long term review.,"Thirty-two dermofasciectomies in 24 cases were reviewed with an average of thirteen years for follow-up. These were compared with the same patients followed-up ten years earlier. A marked increase in extension of the disease from 24% to 79% was noted. The recurrence rate has remained constant at 47% and only two recurrences were found under the skin graft.

A review of 40 rays in 32 patients who had consecutively undergone dermofasciectomy is presented. The average follow-up period was 38 months, with a minimum of 24 months. Four out of the 40 rays developed recurrent nodule formation limited to the proximal or distal graft insets but there was no recurrent cord formation, suggesting better disease control than by fasciectomy alone.

A natural history of Dupuytren's contracture treated by surgical fasciectomy: the influence of diathesis (76 hands reviewed at more than 10 years).,"Fifty-six patients (51 males and 5 females) were reviewed more than 10 years after surgical fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease (average 12 years 7 months). 76 hands were operated upon (20 bilateral cases) for a total of 137 fingers (out of 152 affected digits). The average pre-operative score based on Tubiana's classification was of 4.28. To-date, at maximum follow-up time, it is of 2.45. 34 recurrences occurred before re-operation (i.e. 45%), whereas at maximum follow-up, 74% of hands are still defective, although only 22% cause functional impairment. The method of improvement ratio classifies patients into two categories: satisfactory results and failures. This original method of qualification emphasizes three negative factors: recurrences, initial severity of disease, and failure to achieve full finger extension post-operatively. Results as a whole are in accordance with those mentioned in literature. Improved results depend on early surgery for severe cases, which must therefore be diagnosed at an early stage. Surgery often sets back the disease, without curing it. Further efforts in fundamental research on the etiology of this disease will be needed.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,1284017,1992
Open palm technique for Dupuytren's disease. A five-year follow-up.,"One hundred and seven patients presenting 140 localizations of Dupuytren's disease were operated upon by a single surgeon before 1985, according to a modified Mac Cash procedure combining a Bruner approach and open transverse digital and/or palmar incisions. All surgery was performed under axillary block on an out-patient basis. A striking feature is the absence of complications such as haematoma, skin necrosis or infection. In the early post-operative follow-up (mean 105 days), the average angular improvement was 79.5% in all patients. Among the 107 patients, 54 (for a total of 67 localizations) were specifically reviewed with an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Improvement averaged 74% in 83.5% of digits. In the remaining 16.5%, the lack of extension averaged 31 degrees. Some factors had a negative effect on final results: early age of onset, major involvement of the PIP joint, localization at fifth ray level. The recurrence rate (41%, 23% of which severe) is identical to other reports on limited fasciectomy. A good indication is therefore a patient older than 50, and the method provided low postoperative morbidity and pain, associated with acceptable results.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,1284016,1992
Scientific comment. Basic science of Dupuytren's disease.,"At a cellular level, the major phenomenon in Dupuytren's contracture is an increase in proliferating fibroblasts, rather than an alteration in the type of fibroblasts. The collagen and glycosaminoglycan changes observed in the tissues of Dupuytren's contracture are likely to be secondary to changes in fibroblast density. Oxygen free radicals released from narrowed microvessels and from the fibroblasts themselves may play a role in stimulating fibroblast proliferation. Messina's experiments with continuous distraction and the success of limited fasciotomy indicate a role for physical forces in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture. The mechanism whereby physical events stimulate biochemical changes are undetermined, but preliminary investigations suggest that electrical fields and ion channels may be important. The future of Dupuytren's contracture rests with the delineation of these chemical and physical processes and their application and rigorous testing in the clinical setting.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,1284015,1992
[Correlation between Dupuytren's disease and arcus senilis: is dyslipidemia a common etiopathological factor?].,"Because of the frequent presence of corneal arcus senilis in patients affected by Dupuytren's disease in order to evaluate this association, the authors conducted a biomicroscopic examination of the cornea in 336 patients treated surgically for Dupuytren's disease, at the Hand Surgery Unit of the University of Modena from November 1985 to December 1989. They observed corneal arcus senilis in 259 patients, i.e. in 77.1% of patients with Dupuytren's disease. Due to the statistically significant correlation between arcus senilis and hyperlipidemia as reported by Tschetter (1980) and Felder (1981), the Authors collected a blood sample from all 336 patients to evaluate serum cholesterol and tryglicerides. This study revealed a dyslipidemia in 54.8% of patients with Dupuytren's disease and in 60.2% of patients suffering from both Dupuytren's disease and arcus senilis. Because of the high frequency of dislipidemia in patients with Dupuytren's disease and arcus senilis, which are apparently two well-distinguished disease, the authors suggest that a lipid disorder may be a common aetiopathogenic factor. In particular, in favour of the possible role of hyperlipidemia in Dupuytren's disease, Electron Microscope Studies revealed lipid inclusions within fibroblasts and in the extracellular connective tissue of all pathologic palmar aponeurosis from 11 patients with Dupuytren's disease: these lipid inclusions were never seen in the normal aponeurosis taken from 5 control patients treated for traumatic palmar injuries.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,1280972,1992
Rationale for the need to employ a conservative method in the treatment of patients with dystrophy of the hand.,"Radioimmunoassay determining sexual hormone levels, functional state of the autonomic nervous system and blood supply, were used to study the causes aiding the development of dystrophies of the hand in women.

Pathologic anatomy.,"The typical case shows one or more thickened bands overlying the flexor tendons in the palm that connect with one another via the transverse palmar fascia. Vertical septae fix the bands securely to the underlying fascia and transverse metacarpal ligaments. These septae pass deep between the tendon and neurovascular tunnel. Bands running into the fingers represent thickening and fibrosis of the natatory ligaments. Typically, a central band continues into the finger, forks, and dissipates just distal to the PIP joint. This dissipation occurs with bifurcation of the central band into two thickened bundles that pass deep to the neurovascular bundle and attach to the flexor sheath of the middle phalanx. There are also thickenings of Grayson's ligaments that run from the central cord laterally and dorsally. Understanding the anatomy of the palmar aponeurosis is essential to the effective treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Because the cause is unknown, treatment is best directed at anatomic deformities. Although not systemic or lethal, poorly treated Dupuytren's contracture can lead to significant morbidity and long-term disability. The palmar aponeurosis and its substructures are more than just passive barriers. They integrate hand parts and when pathologically fibrosed can contract joints, deform skin, and deviate neurovascular structures. The best treatments are recognition of the contracture, meticulous dissection, and local radical fasciectomy. Special attention is directed toward protecting spiralling neurovascular bundles. Difficult releases are enhanced by judicious release of checkreins, tendon sheath attachments, and disease on the radial side of the hand.",Hand clinics,1769988,1991
Contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease.,The correction of fixed flexion deformity at the P.I.P. joint in Dupuytren's disease is often difficult. This paper reports an anatomical study of this joint in fingers amputated because of this condition. all the joints would extend fully after release of the accessory collateral ligaments and volar plate. Lateral and dorsal structures showed severe secondary damage and it is suggested that these changes may explain the poor results of corrective surgery to this joint in Dupuytren's disease.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1779164,1991
Two unusual cases of distal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren's contracture.,"Following trauma, two Caucasian males presented with Dupuytren's contracture affecting the distal interphalangeal joint of the little finger and extending onto the dorsum of the digit to insert into the nail bed. Complete excision of the cords and appropriate physiotherapy helped the patients achieve excellent postoperative results.",British journal of plastic surgery,1773223,1991
Unsatisfactory results in Dupuytren's contracture. Philosophies of Dr. J. T. Hueston.,Unsatisfactory results from surgery for Dupuytren's contracture usually arise from complications. The author considers the complications and their subsequent unsatisfactory results that are attributable to the surgeon and those that are attributable to the patient.,Hand clinics,1769997,1991
"Dystrophy, recurrence, and salvage procedures in Dupuytren's contracture.","Postoperative complications can jeopardize the results of surgery. These can be avoided by Y-V plasties that allow for efficient skin &quot;lengthening&quot; and wound healing. Proper dressing techniques can prevent hematoma formation. The patient must be started on early active motion to prevent stiffness, and the physician must monitor for reflex sympathetic dystrophy. If RSD should occur, the dystrophile program is the most effective means of treatment. Fasciectomy alone is not always successful in correcting Dupuytren's contracture, especially in longstanding cases. The surgeon should be prepared to correct other entities such as checkreins, sheath fibrosis, and tendon adhesions. Occasionally, a severely compromised finger is not amenable to correction. In this case, salvage procedures are available, such as the concentric arthrodesis that preserves the length of the volar structures. Only when all other attempts fail should one resort to amputation.",Hand clinics,1769996,1991
The use of the full thickness skin graft in Dupuytren's contracture.,"For those hand surgeons who have experienced early complications associated with limited fasciectomies (those who have not, have not done enough limited fasciectomies) and are frustrated by a high rate of recurrence or extension of the disease, incision of the cord and interposition of a full thickness graft is a technique to seriously consider. The procedure is not difficult to perform, but patience and attention to detail are prerequisites for success. That success is measured by complete or near complete release of the contracture with a minimum of morbidity, a nil recurrence rate, and extension rate of less than 10%. This technique is indicated for patients who have one or more elements of the Dupuytren's diathesis. Usually people older than 65 who develop Dupuytren's contracture do not have the diathesis, and their disease can be managed by limited fasciectomy and Z plasty skin lengthening. Finally, Dupuytren's disease presenting with no contracture can be managed effectively and conservatively by a series of intralesional injections of triamcinolone into the nodules and cords, the treatment of choice for all plantar nodules and knuckle pads.",Hand clinics,1769995,1991
The open palm technique.,"Dupuytren's disease presents a difficult problem that should not be treated casually. It is a continuing, unpredictable condition in which surgery is the only treatment available when contracture occurs. Surgery itself may cause an acceleration of the disease. Patients should be made aware that this is a continuing problem, often unpredictable in its course, with and without treatment. It is a pervasive disease, and when surgery is unsuccessful, the hand that underwent surgery may worsen. The open palm technique is a useful technique for avoiding complications in the early postoperative period. It is particularly useful in those patients with significant metacarpophalangeal joint contractures at more than one finger. The open palm technique does not affect the long-term outcome in these patients.",Hand clinics,1769994,1991
Surgical alternatives in Dupuytren's contracture.,"The treatment of Dupuytren's contracture is still controversial. The use of subcutaneous fasciotomy is useful in the medically unstable patient in whom long-term results may be a moot point. Limited fasciectomy is preferred over radical excision as a simpler operation and because of fewer complications. Wound closure is still a major point of contention. A prospective, randomized study of open wounds versus skin grafts versus closed procedures is needed to give more information regarding the long-term results. Currently, at our institution, we perform limited fasciectomy and leave the palm open. Early and aggressive mobilization is thought to be the key to good results.",Hand clinics,1769993,1991
Dupuytren's contracture in women.,Dupuytren's contracture in women is similar to that in men. A limited fasciectomy is the operative procedure of choice for women with Dupuytren's contracture. The most significant difference between men and women is the higher incidence of a flare reaction in women following the operation. This must be considered when contemplating such procedures because the flare is associated with a greater risk of residual joint stiffness.,Hand clinics,1769992,1991
Anesthesia for Dupuytren's contracture.,"Despite the potential complications of brachial plexus blockade, it remains a reliable and safe form of anesthesia for surgery of the upper extremity. The site of the surgery dictates which of the four approaches to the brachial plexus should be used. When the choice matches the site of surgery, the blocks should be successful in approximately 80% of cases. When supplemented with an additional peripheral block, the success rate is greater than 90% using the axillary and supraclavicular approaches. The duration of the blocks varies from 1 to 12 hours, depending on the choice of anesthetic agent. The addition of epinephrine to the anesthetic agent decreases the rate of tissue uptake of the drug, thereby both lengthening the duration of the block and decreasing the toxicity of the agent. Alkalinizing lidocaine with sodium bicarbonate decreases the latency time and increases the intensity and spread of the block. Surgeons should be aware of the advantages and capabilities of regional anesthesia and should discuss anesthesia options with patients and anesthesiologists.",Hand clinics,1769991,1991
The myofibroblast in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture nodules, but not cords, contain myofibroblasts. These cells, which combine many electron microscopic, physiologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, are probably the active force of contraction. Prominent myofibroblasts and intracellular microtubules correlate with increased likelihood of clinical recurrence after surgery. Tissue culture of cells derived from Dupuytren's contracture myofibroblasts show consistently slower cell replication than from fibroblasts and show persistence of electron microscopic characteristics in early passages. Research in Dupuytren's contracture myofibroblasts has been done on human tissue and so has clinical correlation. Myofibroblast presence may help to predict recurrence of disease and suggests that palmar skin should be excised when adherent to disease nodules. The theory of myofibroblasts helps explain why the open technique often succeeds, and why full thickness skin grafts inhibit recurrent contracture.",Hand clinics,1769990,1991
The role of the fibroblast in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and biochemical studies to date show that the fibroblast in Dupuytren's contracture is identical to palmar fascia fibroblasts in patients unaffected by Dupuytren's contracture, and to all other fibroblasts. The major difference relating to fibroblasts is that in Dupuytren's contracture there are more of them, and they are clustered around narrowed microvessels. It is probable that these two phenomena are linked because recent studies indicate a greater potential for ischemia-induced oxygen free radical generation in Dupuytren's contracture, and because oxygen free radicals in these concentrations can stimulate fibroblast proliferation. The major source of oxygen free radicals is likely to be from microvascular endothelial xanthine oxidase-catalyzed reactions. These observations also account for many of the epidemiologic associations of Dupuytren's contracture, because (1) age, race, and diabetes are associated with microvessel narrowing and (2) age, diabetes, alcohol consumption, HIV infection, cigarette smoking, and trauma are associated with increased free radical generation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and allopurinol are two agents that decrease oxygen free radical release and may inhibit or prevent Dupuytren's contracture.",Hand clinics,1769989,1991
Anatomy and pathogenesis of the digital cords and nodules.,"Current theories on the origin of the diseased tissue in Dupuytren's contracture are reviewed, and previous descriptions of the pathologic anatomy are clarified. The pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture is cited, with emphasis on the development of the contracture at various sites.",Hand clinics,1769987,1991
Diagnosis and indications for surgical treatment.,"Dupuytren's disease is a common problem in most hand surgery practices. It is usually easily diagnosed by the presence of its primary palmar manifestations: the nodule, the cord, and the digital flexion contracture. The isolated nodule may occasionally require biopsy to rule out the possibility of malignancy, but this is unusual. The nodule is typically the first lesion to appear and is the site of active biologic activity. The cord is the pathologically thickened and shortened normal longitudinal fascial structure of the palm and digit. Its insertion distal to the MPJ or PIP accounts for the progressive flexion contracture of these joints. Secondary findings include knuckle pads, plantar fascial nodules, and penile fascial contracture, which may signal the presence of Dupuytren's diathesis, a particularly aggressive form of the disease. The need and advisability of surgical intervention should be determined in close consultation with the patient after becoming thoroughly familiar with functional deficits and specific functional goals. A flexion contracture of more than 30 degrees at the MPJ or any contracture at the PIP is generally thought to be an indication for palmar fasciectomy. Patients should be aware of potential complications, those in higher risk categories should be identified preoperatively. Details of the operative procedure and variations in technique are discussed in subsequent articles in this issue.",Hand clinics,1769986,1991
Some medicolegal aspects of Dupuytren's contracture.,"This article presents the medical and legal aspects of Dupuytren's contracture. It also presents a rational basis for the assessment of the relationship, if any, between a patient's occupation and the development of Dupuytren's contracture.",Hand clinics,1769984,1991
Histochemical localization of glycoconjugates in the palmar aponeurosis of Dupuytren's patients.,"Acridine orange added to the primary fixative or reduced osmium tetroxide as postfixative have been used in order to localize by thin section electron microscopy glycoconjugates in the extracellular matrix of the normal palmar aponeurosis as well as in tissues at different stages of Dupuytren's contracture. After use of acridine orange or reduced osmium tetroxide, in the nodule of the active stage an extensive network of fine filaments separated single or small bundles of collagen fibrils from each other. In the cord of the residual stage fixed in presence of acridine orange, the tightly packed collagen fibrils in the central region of the specimens were swollen and had stained material interposed between the single microfibrils. In specimens of the same cord first fixed with glutaraldehyde alone, followed by reduced osmium tetroxide, the disaggregation of collagen fibrils could be seen only occasionally and the intrafibrillar stained glycoconjugates were less evident. Comparable alterations were absent from the normal tissue. The possible reasons of these differences are discussed.",Journal of submicroscopic cytology and pathology,1764681,1991
Dupuytren's disease among the Chinese in Taiwan.,"A retrospective study was made of 41 cases of Dupuytren's disease observed from 1970 to 1988 at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan. The patients' ages ranged from 49 to 78 years; 21 patients had only one hand involved; 20 patients showed bilateral involvement. Thirty-three of 35 diseased hands with contracture were treated by regional fasciectomy. A follow-up study was done in 32 hands. The operative results of 30 hands were rated as good (94%); 3 showed extension of the disease and 1 had evidence of recurrence. Treatment was not given to 26 hands without contracture; 14 of these showed no change in the lesions, 3 improved, and 6 were worse when seen on subsequent visits. Seventeen of 33 excised thickened palmar fasciae contained nodules. All histological sections of nodule-free specimens showed dense connective tissues. Based on the fibroblastic activity and the amount of collagen, three easily discernible features of the histological make-up of the nodules were found.",The Journal of hand surgery,1940153,1991
Dupuytren's disease: relation to work and injury.,"The present status of adjudication for workers claiming compensation for Dupuytren's disease is inconsistent and, therefore, unfair to both workers and employers. In some Eastern European countries Dupuytren's disease is classified as an industrial disease, whereas in other countries it is considered to have no relation to manual work or hand injury. In jurisdictions that sometimes award compensation, the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a claim vary from case to case and are not necessarily based on our present knowledge of the disease. The purpose of this communication is to highlight the features of Dupuytren's disease that are pertinent to manual work and hand injury and to suggest guidelines that would provide some consistency in the adjudication process. It is hoped that these guidelines would be valuable to the individual surgeon, insurance agencies, and compensation boards.",The Journal of hand surgery,1834729,1991
HLA association of idiopathic Peyronie's disease: an indication of autoimmune phenomena in etiopathogenesis?,"HLA typing for class I and class II antigens was done in 52 unrelated patients suffering from idiopathic Peyronie's disease. The controversially discussed association with the HLA-B7 cross-reacting group could not be confirmed. Marked deviations of antigen frequencies were observed for HLA-A1, B8, Cw7, DR3 and DQw2 compared to healthy local controls. After correction of p-values, A1 (pc less than 0.05) and DQw2 (pc less than 0.01) remained significant. A possible association of Peyronie's disease with markers of the HLA-A1, B8, Cw7, DR3, DQw2 haplotype, as first described here, would suggest autoimmunological factors in this disorder of otherwise unknown etiopathogenesis.",Tissue antigens,1796451,1991
Transglutaminase levels in Dupuytren's disease.,"By use of immunoperoxidase staining, tissue transglutaminase and aminopropeptide of collagen type III were localized to fibroblasts running within cords of Dupuytren's fascia. Quantitative analysis of transglutaminase revealed that activity levels were significantly higher in acutely contracting fascia than in chronic contractures. The results show that contractures in Dupuytren's fascia may be reflected by the level of transglutaminase activity in the tissue. Furthermore, it is suggested that isopeptide bond formation, involving collagen type III aminopropeptide moieties, may be the biochemical mechanism by which transglutaminase maintains the contracted state.",The Journal of hand surgery,1682354,1991
Dupuytren's contracture: the long-term results after day surgery.,"220 operations in 211 hands in 160 consecutive patients suffering from Dupuytren's contracture were performed from 1976 through 1984 at the Kuopio University Central Hospital in Finland. 179 operations were carried out as day cases. The mean follow-up was 3.2 years. Sub-total fasciectomy resulted in good immediate and long-term improvement in 86% of patients. The recurrence rate was 27%. Surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture was well-suited to day surgery. A properly planned follow-up programme is suggested because of the relatively high rate of recurrence, which usually appeared within two years after operation.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1960492,1991
An investigation into the role of inflammatory cells in Dupuytren's disease.,"An immunohistochemical study was performed on nodules excised from the palmar fascia of patients with Dupuytren's contracture. In cellular nodules, antibodies to actin (used as a marker for myofibroblasts), desmin, vimentin, Mac 387 (a macrophage marker) and leucocyte common antigen were used. A correlation was demonstrated between the numbers of macrophages and the presence of myofibroblasts. The presence of myofibroblasts is generally considered to indicate the active stage of the disease. Inflammatory cells other than macrophages were largely absent from the nodules, although lymphocytes were frequent in the tissue around the nodules. Microvascular changes were prominent in the nodules and pericyte proliferation was observed around occluded capillaries. Release of growth factors from macrophages may be important in Dupuytren's contracture, as is the case in other fibrotic diseases. The possible role of macrophages in the aetiology of Dupuytren's disease is discussed.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1960491,1991
The collagen changes of Dupuytren's contracture.,"In Dupuytren's contracture there is an increase in the ratio of type III to type I collagen. The objective of this study was to determine if fibroblasts from patients with Dupuytren's contracture have an intrinsic aberration in collagen production or whether local factors govern the collagen changes in Dupuytren's contracture. Using a new collagen micro-method, we found that fibroblasts cultured from palmar fascia affected by Dupuytren's contracture produced similar collagen to fibroblasts derived from the palmar fascia of age- and sex-matched patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Furthermore, the collagen changes of Dupuytren's contracture could be reproduced in all cell lines by increasing fibroblast density. At high fibroblast density, type I collagen production was inhibited: a finding that could account for the increased types III/I collagen ratio in Dupuytren's contracture. These results suggest that a genetic defect in collagen production is unlikely and that the important phenomenon is an increase in fibroblast density.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1960490,1991
Epidemiological and structural findings supporting the fibromatous origin of dorsal knuckle pads.,"Epidemiological, optical and electron microscopical findings suggest that dorsal knuckle pads and Dupuytren's disease are fibrosing disorders with common features. In all cases examined, knuckle pads were always associated with Dupuytren's contracture and, in a significant number of cases, with bilateral Dupuytren's contracture. In a statistically significant number of patients with knuckle pads, Ledderhose's and Peyronie's diseases were also present (P less than 0.001). Optical and electron microscopical studies showed that cell types and extracellular matrix were identical in knuckle pads and Dupuytren's nodules in different patients.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1960489,1991
Segmental aponeurectomy for Dupuytren's disease: a prospective study.,"A prospective study was carried out on segmental aponeurectomy for Dupuytren's contracture. 46 patients (50 hands) with primary disease were entered into the study. The procedure uses a series of C-shaped incisions to permit excision of small segments (approximately one centimetre) of diseased tissue along the affected ray. Segmental aponeurectomy achieved similar correction of deformity to limited fasciectomy. There was only one wound complication and no wound haematomas. Two patients lost flexion and one digital nerve was damaged. The incidence of recurrence at one year was no higher than with other techniques. Segmental aponeurectomy is a valuable alternative operation for Dupuytren's contracture, particularly in elderly patients.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1960488,1991
Segmental aponeurectomy in Dupuytren's disease.,"We report 213 consecutive segmental aponeurectomies in 175 patients. Through several small curved skin incisions, segments of diseased tissue about 1 cm long were excised. No attempts were made to remove all the Dupuytren's tissue, the aim being to achieve discontinuity. The results are described in detail and compare well with conventional techniques of partial fasciectomy.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",1960487,1991
Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a disease of the palmar and digital fascia that results in a flexion deformity of the fingers. Although the first case was reported more than 350 years ago, many questions remain unanswered. With our present state of knowledge, treatment remains empiric and operative intervention is the only successful mode of treatment. Controversies continue over the type of procedure used, as well as its timing. In light of the high rate of recurrence of flexion contractures after apparently successful operations, current research is being directed toward identifying a biochemical or histologic marker to indicate the probability of recurrence.",Southern medical journal,1882276,1991

"Dupuytren's contracture. Surgical principles, nursing implications.","Successful Dupuytren's surgery requires the cooperation of the patient, the surgeon, and the therapist. Cooperation of the patient is enhanced by nursing care. Preoperative and postoperative teaching by the nurse also contribute to positive outcomes.

Fibronectin filaments and actin microfilaments are organized into a fibronexus in Dupuytren's diseased tissue.,"The fibronexus is a close transmembrane association between fibronectin filaments and actin microfilaments. It has been found at the surfaces of fibroblasts in tissue culture, as well as within contracting granulation tissue. This specialized connection has been proposed to play an important role in the adhesive properties of fibroblasts. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the fibronexus is present in other contracting tissues besides granulation tissue, specifically in Dupuytren's diseased tissue. Dupuytren's disease is a pathologic condition in which the palmar aponeurosis becomes shortened leading to irreversible flexion of the digits. Shortening of the aponeurosis is believed to be an active cellular process. Extracellular filaments and actin microfilaments form close transmembrane associations at the surfaces of actin-rich fibroblasts in Dupuytren's disease. Extracellular filaments extend from the cell surface into the surrounding tissue connecting fibroblasts with collagen fibrils and adjacent cells. In this study we have used immunoelectron microscopy to demonstrate that the extracellular filaments that participate in these close transmembrane associations contain fibronectin. High voltage electron microscopy has been used to examine the three-dimensional relationships between the cytoskeleton and fibronectin filaments in Dupuytren's diseased tissue. We propose that the fibronexus is a dominant adhesive structure at the surface of fibroblasts in Dupuytren's diseased tissue. The fibronexus, by mediating cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix attachments, may serve to transmit contractile forces generated by actin microfilaments in these cells throughout the diseased tissue.",The Anatomical record,1867394,1991
Simultaneous carpal tunnel release and Dupuytren's fasciectomy.,Simultaneous operations for carpal tunnel syndrome and Dupuytren's disease have been reported in only one study which recommended staged treatment because there was an 87% complication rate with simultaneous treatment. The present study reviewed simultaneous treatment of 30 patients during a 20-year period. Complications and unfavourable results were compared to similar groups of patients who underwent either Dupuytren's fasciectomy or carpal tunnel release as sole procedures. Early complications (13%) were far less than in previous studies and were easily corrected. The incidence of recurrence and extension (20%) was lower than in the Dupuytren's fasciectomy group and much lower than in previous reports. Simultaneous carpal tunnel release and Dupuytren's fasciectomy are strongly recommended when these conditions are both present in the same hand.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2061659,1991

Association between connective tissue changes and smoking habit in type 2 diabetes and in non-diabetic humans.,"Two hundred type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and 170 non-diabetic age- and sex-matched normotensive controls were examined for limited joint mobility (LJM) and Dupuytren's contracture (DC), and their smoking history was documented. The prevalences of LJM and DC were not significantly different in diabetic and control subjects (LJM: odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.50; DC: odds ratio 1.34, CI 0.81 to 2.23). Cigarette smoking was positively associated with both LJM and DC in the diabetic patients (LJM: relative risk (R) = 1.96, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.49; DC: R = 2.88, CI 1.29 to 6.43) and in the control group (LJM: R = 2.22, CI 1.70 to 5.86; DC: R = 2.71, CI 1.23 to 5.89). Limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture are both associated with cigarette smoking in type 2 diabetic patients and in age-matched non-diabetic subjects. This suggests that type 2 diabetes is only one of a number of factors which promote the development of these connective tissue changes.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2022177,1991
Two flaps to resurface the basal flexion-crease of the finger area.,"Two flaps are described which have been designed to resurface the skin around the basal flexion crease of the fingers. Their most common use is on the ulnar side of the hand but any finger can be resurfaced. Both flaps are 1 cm in width so the donor sites can be repaired directly without the use of skin grafts. Mobilisation of the fingers is therefore permissible within 24 hours and thus postoperative stiffness avoided. The one-stage cross-finger flap is of particular value in resurfacing and preventing the recurrence of Dupuytren's in the M.P. joint area. The palmar transposition flap based on the inter-digital cleft is useful for the release of volar contractures and resurfacing localised full thickness burns. They are quick to raise and very reliable, providing their nutrient vessel is retained. The donor site distortion is minimal. We have had no flap loss and no limitation of flexion.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2007822,1991

Running Y-V plasty.,"Problems in treating burn sequelae include scar tissue contraction, which may develop after wound infections, after secondary wound healing by granulations, and also after split-skin transplants. Development of scar cords near or even over joints can ultimately lead to deformities of the body and limbs because of restriction of mobility. Compression bandages have the goal of counteracting these problems, but are not always effective. An attempt must be made to resect the scar cords and to cover the defect with skin transplants or to change the line of the scar cord with Z plasties. However, the altered blood flow in the nodularly twisted collagen fiber structure of the hypertrophic scar frequently causes the tips of transposed skin flaps (as, for example, in Z plasties) to become necrotic. This situation is avoided by application of Y-V plasties, in which the skin for transposition is not detached from its substratum (in contrast to the Z plasty) but is displaced by sliding it on its substratum. For this purpose, the tension of the scar cord is eliminated over the entire length by several transverse Y-shaped incisions situated in parallel. If the tongues of the upper part slide into the stem of the Y and finally from a V, the scar cord can be lengthened without raising the dermis from it substratum and endangering its blood flow. Because of good results, Y-V plasty has entirely replaced Z plasty in the correction of contracted burn scars at my hospital.",Annals of plastic surgery,1994813,1991

[Treatment of recurrent Dupuytren's disease by scalar incision and firebreak graft].,"We report our experience of the use of a scalar type incision associated with a total skin graft in the treatment of recurrences of Dupuytren's contracture. This is not an original technique, but one described by Hueston in 1984, which consists of a &quot;Fire Break&quot; skin graft after a simple transverse incision of recurrent Dupuytren's contracture. We attribute the absence of recurrence with this graft to the impossibility of the disease to affect the thin tissue between the skin graft and the underlying tendons. Our series is composed of 25 patients, all male. The majority of these patients had undergone surgery on a single occasion before treatment of recurrences with an average time interval of seven years. In a great majority of cases the little finger was deformed and generally severely (stage III or IV). All of our patients were reviewed with a mean follow-up of 28 months after surgery, and we did not observe any recurrences under the graft. In this series, which remains too small and too recent, 67% of cases presented an acceptable result with nearly complete extension and satisfactory grasp. We do not apply this technique to the treatment of all cases of recurrent Dupuytren's contracture, but we reserve it preferentially for elderly patients, operated on several occasions for ulnar fingers especially the little finger, in digital or digito-palmar forms in which the deformity predominates on the proximal interphalangeal joint with marked digital infiltration.",Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,1712163,1991
Familial hypodontia associated with Dupuytren's disease.,"A three-generation Finnish family exhibited hypodontia associated with Dupuytren's disease (contracture). Of the known 32 members of the family, contracture has been diagnosed thus far in 5 individuals, 4 of these also with hypodontia. No other connective tissue involvement was found. For comparison, three other families were studied, also showing incomplete penetrance of hypodontia. Bearing in mind the genetic isolation of the Finnish population, this finding may be coincidental. The possibility of partially common genetic background cannot, however, be excluded.",Scandinavian journal of dental research,2091241,1990

Fasciectomy for treatment of Dupuytren's disease and early complications.,"This review of 103 cases of hands operated on for treatment of Dupuytren's disease demonstrates the significant increase of postoperative stiffness as related to recurrences and staging of the disease, but not to sex. On the contrary, the frequency of reflex sympathetic dystrophy after fasciectomy is sex related affecting females. The protective effect of guanethidine may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for female patients. We propose that the disease be staged on the basis of anatomic findings, inasmuch as staging based on degree of contracture alone is insufficient for comparative studies.",The Journal of hand surgery,2229974,1990

Aetiology of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Dupuytren's contracture is a fascinating, deforming, fibrotic condition of the palmar fascia which has confounded clinicians and scientists for centuries. The aim of this paper is to place in perspective the longstanding associations of age, sex, race, hereditary factors, diabetes and alcohol consumption with the more recent novel investigations at the cellular level. In concert, the findings indicate that a number of factors may lead to the narrowing of palmar fascia microvessels, with localized ischaemia and oxygen free radical release. Oxygen free radicals are likely to damage the surrounding stroma, and stimulate fibroblast proliferation. Proliferating fibroblasts lay down collagen and contract in the lines of stress. The process is likely to encourage further microvessel ischaemia with a positive feedback effect that is consistent with the progressive nature of the condition.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery,2322211,1990
Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is an extremely common malady, affecting as many as 3% of the general population. Presenting features are variable and include simple asymptomatic palmar nodules or refractory contractures of the interphalangeal joints. Substantial associations with knuckle pads, plantar nodules, and Peyronie's disease are noteworthy. Although a strong familial tendency is present, the precise pathologic mechanism is unknown. Treatment is frequently unnecessary, but when indicated it includes a variety of surgical alternatives. An appropriately timed referral to a surgical specialist before irreversible contracture of the interphalangeal joints can prevent a permanent loss of function. When surgical intervention is not elected, careful and regular follow-up is necessary to detect early joint contracture.",The Western journal of medicine,2190416,1990

[Clinical anatomy of the digital connective tissue cord of the ulnar side of the little finger].,"A fibrous cord with a length of nearly 60 mm and a width of 3 mm consistency starts near the insertion of the abductor digiti minimi muscle at the ulnar border of the little finger. The fibers pass parallel to the longitudinal direction of the little finger and at the level of the osseous ridges on the palmar side of the flexion-extension axis of the finger joints. Proximally the cord receives fibers from the periosteum at the base of the proximal phalanx, from the ulnar end of the natatory ligament, and from the pretendinous fibers of the A1 pulley. Distally the digital cord has connections to the cutaneous ligaments of Grayson and Cleland. The cord also joins the flexor tendon sheath, the neurovascular bundles, and the skin. Sometimes these cords are involved in Dupuytren's contracture.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",2338307,1990

Cell-controlling factors in Dupuytren's contracture.,"The search for the causative factors in Dupuytren's disease has historically progressed form gross anatomical dissection, through microscopical tissue studies, to the biochemistry of the collagen produced. But these elements are merely the end products of cellular activity - not revealing the factors responsible for the changes in cellular activity. Recent biochemical investigations suggest that a number of conditions including localized microvascular ischemia and high alcohol concentrations transform the &quot;benign&quot; xanthine dehydrogenase of endothelial cells to the oxygen-free radical-releasing xanthine oxidase. Oxygen-free radicals are highly reactive species with half-lives in the order of milliseconds capable of both damaging the surrounding peri-microvasculature and stimulating fibroblast proliferation. It is this stimulation of fibroblast proliferation in the palmar fascia that is the key event in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture.",Annales de chirurgie de la main et du membre superieur : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main = Annals of hand and upper limb surgery,1695516,1990

Dupuytren is remembered principally for the hand condition which bears his name; his other numerous and more-important contributions have been ignored. Never happy outside the operating room--or perhaps inside it either, due to his mania for perfection--this arrogant master surgeon constantly clashed with his colleagues, staff and the few friends he had.

Prediction of recurrence in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease: evaluation of a histologic classification.,"Histologic staging of Dupuytren's lesions into three types is proposed: a proliferative type with high cellularity and mitosis, a fibrocellular type characterized by the presence of a reticulin network, and a fibrous type with few cells. Sixty-three patients (77 hands) who had selective fasciectomy as a primary procedure and whose histologic specimen was available were clinically reviewed for disease recurrence and extension. Twenty-two hands (29%) were free of disease; twenty-five (32%) were free from recurrence but showed an extension, and thirty (39%) had a recurrence. This histologic classification seems to have a prognostic value because the recurrence rate is higher in type I (70%) and lower in type III (18%). The risk of extension did not correlate with the histologic type.",The Journal of hand surgery,2754197,1989

Dupuytren's contracture. Fine structure in relation to aetiology.,"The fine structure of palmar fascia from patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) was compared with that from patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In contrast to previous assumptions, the ultrastructure of fibroblasts both in vivo and in vitro from DC and CTS appeared identical, indicating that myofibroblasts are not specific to DC. The major differences between DC and CTS were: 1) a sixfold and fortyfold increase in fibroblast density in cord and nodular areas of DC compared with CTS; 2) a more disorganised pattern of collagen fibrils in DC; and 3) markedly narrowed microvessels surrounded by thickened, laminated basal laminae and proliferating fibroblasts in DC compared with CTS. To account for these morphological changes a hypothesis is presented which proposes that oxygen-free radicals cause pericytic necrosis and fibroblastic proliferation. This hypothesis provides a potential avenue for therapy of DC and other fibrotic conditions.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume,2722922,1989

Isolation and characterization of collagen in Peyronie's disease.,"Peyronie's disease is characterized histologically by excessive collagen deposition in the lesion. We examined the collagen types in Peyronie's disease plaque tissues compared to unaffected tissues from the same patient, other control tissues, and Dupuytren's contracture. Gel electrophoresis of pepsin-solubilized collagen demonstrated the presence of type I collagen and an increased content of type III collagen in plaque tissue. Increased type III collagen was detected in apparently normal tissue adjacent to the plaque and in Dupuytren's lesion, confirming previous findings. Although the cause of excessive collagen accumulation of Peyronie's disease is unknown, the results suggest an imbalance in the regulation of extracellular matrix production leading to pathologic fibrosis.",The Journal of urology,2918606,1989
[The importance of subclavian vein stenosis for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture].,"The postoperative healing in cases of Dupuytren's contracture is not only influenced by the age of the patient and the progress of the disease, but also by the existence of other accompanying diseases and general and local factors. The appearance of postoperative edema and the so-called hand-finger-syndrome are also especially unfavorable, because these complications determine the duration of treatment and the functional results. As a cause for these postoperative complications a disorder of the subclavian vein could be found and documented by means of phlebography. Preoperative examination of the venous situation is therefore an important diagnostic step to determine indications and to allow an estimation of the postoperative course and the duration of treatment. Demonstration of cases and statistical evaluation of our patients over the last five years show the importance of this observation.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",2707653,1989
"Limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture and retinopathy in type 1 diabetes: association with cigarette smoking.","To examine the associations between cigarette smoking, connective tissue changes, and diabetic retinopathy, a detailed smoking history was elicited from 150 normotensive non-diabetic subjects, and from 266 randomly selected adult patients with Type 1 diabetes, after examination for limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture, and diabetic retinopathy. Mean insulin dose and current glycosylated haemoglobin concentrations were comparable in diabetic smokers and non-smokers. The historical duration of smoking correlated with the duration of diabetes (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). In diabetic patients limited joint mobility was positively associated with retinopathy, being found in 73/147 (50%) patients with retinopathy compared with 20/114 (18%) without retinopathy (chi 2 = 28.9, p less than 0.001), and also with Dupuytren's contracture, 19/34 (56%) of patients with limited joint mobility having Dupuytren's contracture, compared with 76/232 (33%) of patients without Dupuytren's contracture (chi 2 = 7.05, p less than 0.01). Limited joint mobility was observed in 50% of diabetic smokers compared with 25% of non-smokers (odds ratio = 2.87 (corrected for diabetes duration), 95% confidence interval 1.64-5.01). Diabetic retinopathy was weakly associated with smoking (odds ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.60-1.96). There was however an increased prevalence of background retinopathy among male smokers (50% vs 29%; chi 2 = 6.88, p less than 0.01). In non-diabetic males limited joint mobility was observed in 37% of smokers but only in 11% of non-smokers (NS), while 33% of smokers and 8% of non-smokers had Dupuytren's contracture (p = 0.012). These results suggest that cigarette smoking contributes to the development of extra-articular connective tissue changes in both diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects, and possibly to the development of diabetic retinopathy.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2522859,1989
Characterization of implants from Dupuytren's contracture tissue into the nude (athymic) mouse.,"Dupuytren's contracture tissues were obtained from six patients as excess surgical material. Pieces of these tissues (a total of 38 implants) were placed into subcutaneous pockets in the suprascapular area of nude (athymic) mice. The objective was to determine whether the implant tissues would be maintained in the mouse with the characteristics of Dupuytren's tissue. The implants were removed for study at 14-179 days after implantation. Microvascular anastomosis between implant and host skin was established within the first 14 days. Histologic character and electron microscopic structure of the implants did not change during the course of the study. The implants became reduced in size with time. However, neither the spatial pattern of collagen nor the appearance of fibroblast cells changed. The original high levels of chondroitin-4-sulfate were significantly decreased in the 66- to 179-day postimplantation group, but were not significantly different from the values for normal fascial bands. The hyaluronic acid of the implants increased significantly with time of implantation, but never reached the level found in the normal fascial bands. The use of implants into nude mice may be useful for further experimental studies of Dupuytren's contracture.","Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Since the young age all the patients manifested gynecomastia. Besides, later one of the brothers developed scirrhus of the left mammary gland. Clinically, Kennedy's spinal amyotrophy in the R. family manifested itself by asymmetric distribution of myotrophies (more pronounced in the left limbs), bilateral Dupuytren's contractures in the hands. Apart from the signs of injuries to motoneurons of the anterior horns, electromyography and electroneuromyography have shown the peripheral nerves to be involved into the pathological process.","Zhurnal nevropatologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Our purpose was to evaluate if characteristic features of Dupuytren aponeurosis are in some way influenced by alterations in collagenic and elastic bundles present in Marfan syndrome. So we compared histological, enzymatic and immunochemical features of tissue fragments from Marfan with similar fragments from simple Dupuytren patients. We observed a substantial difference in the predominant type of collagen which is adult type I in the normal Dupuytren disease and fetal type III in Marfan patient. Collagenic bundles are more dispersed in Marfan, and the whole aponeurosis seems less compact and resistant. No difference was observed in cellular populations of aponeurosis, and also myofibroblasts are present with abundant myosin ATPase activity both in Marfan with Dupuytren both in Dupuytren alone.",Archivio &quot;Putti&quot; di chirurgia degli organi di movimento,2624543,1989

Hand abnormalities are associated with the complications of diabetes in type 2 diabetes.,"Limited finger joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture, and the complications of diabetes were assessed in 233 Type 2 diabetic patients. Limited joint mobility was present in 34% and Dupytren's contracture in 26%. The prevalence of limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture increased with duration of diabetes and with age. Logistic regression analysis showed that, after allowing for age and duration of diabetes, limited joint mobility was independently associated with Dupuytren's contracture (odds ratio 5.7, 95% CI 2.0-16.4) and retinopathy (odds ratio 3.1, CI 1.5-6.4). Dupuytren's contracture was independently associated with vision-threatening retinopathy (odds ratio 2.6, CI 1.1-6.4), limited joint mobility (odds ratio 2.5, CI 1.3-4.8), and foot ulceration (odds ratio 4.9, CI 1.4-16.4). Both Dupuytren's contracture and limited joint mobility were associated with peripheral neuropathy but neither hand abnormality was associated with neuropathy independently of other complications of diabetes. The association of connective tissue abnormalities in the hand with the complications of diabetes suggests that similar factors may be contributing to their pathogenesis.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2522373,1989
[Intravenous regional sympathetic block with guanethidine. Retrospective study of 251 blocks of the upper limb in 68 patients].,"68 patients have been treated by regional intravenous blocks with guanethidine. 251 blocks have been realized. The majority of the patients received 3 blocks of one week. Some of them got a second series of 3 blocks after a minimum interval of one month. The study included 3 groups of patients. The first group showed 12 patients in the first stage of Sudeck; the second group 22 patients in the second stage. The third group included 34 patients for which the indication to blockade had been a chronic painful stage (19 cases), an ankylosis (8 cases), a Dupuytren post-traumatic contracture (3 cases) a stage before the operation predisposing to dystrophy reflex (3 cases) and one case of hyperhidrosis of the hand. Considering the three groups it can be stated that the first one responded the best to the treatment with a success in 80% of the cases. This success confirms the necessity of intervening as soon as possible in case of an algoneurodystrophy. The third group reveals that this therapeutical method can be useful in other situations than the dystrophy reflexes. The indication herewith is more founded on a possible sympathetic origin of the troubles as on the comportment psycho-affective of the patient.","Zeitschrift fur Unfallchirurgie, Versicherungsmedizin und Berufskrankheiten : offizielles Organ der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft fur Unfallmedizin und Berufskrankheiten = Revue de traumatologie, d'assicurologie et des maladies professio...",2481373,1989

New facts about the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture.,"A histotopographical study is presented of the innervation of the palmar aponeurosis in human embryos and foetuses of both sexes and in adults. Beginning with the 4.5 to 5th months of embryonic development and later on in adults, too, the ulnar margin of the distal part of palmar aponeurosis (i.e., tendons of digits 4 and 5 most likely to be affected by Dupuytren's contracture) is the most abundantly equipped with encapsulated receptors of the type of Vater-Pacini corpuscles. With reference to a study of the microcirculation of palmar aponeurosis proprioreceptors in the norm and to the histophysiology of Vater-Pacini corpuscles in the norm and in Dupuytren's contracture the author presents the view that primary impairment of microcirculation in the proprioreceptors of palmar aponeurosis due to a variety of causes is part of the basic pathogenesis of the condition.",Acta chirurgiae plasticae,2472714,1989

Cigarette smoking and Dupuytren's contracture of the hand.,"Microvascular occlusion has been implicated as a possible causative factor of Dupuytren's contracture. Cigarette smoking is one of the most significant factors in the development of peripheral vasculopathy. The relationship between smoking and Dupuytren's contracture of the hand is explored in this article. One hundred thirty-two consecutive patients who had a partial fasciectomy for treatment of Dupuytren's contracture from 1980 to 1985, were analyzed retrospectively. There were 111 males and 21 females. Ninety (68.2%) of 132 patients smoked cigarettes compared with 110 (37.2%) of 296 randomized hospitalized control patients (p less than 0.00001). Eighty (72.1%) of 111 men smoked cigarettes compared with 65 (44.2%) of 147 male control patients (p = 0.000015). Cigarette smoking is linked statistically to Dupuytren's disease and may be involved in its pathogenesis by producing microvascular occlusion and subsequent fibrosis and contracture or by some other mechanism.",The Journal of hand surgery,3225413,1988
Prostaglandins influence myofibroblast contractility in Dupuytren's disease.,"This study investigated if the vasoactive prostaglandins, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha, were identifiable in association with nodular myofibroblasts of patients with Dupuytren's disease. Immunocytochemic studies, using antibodies specific for these prostaglandins, have confirmed their association with myofibroblasts. Radioimmunoassay was used to quantitate the prostaglandins. Our results indicate a significant increase of both prostaglandins, especially PGF2 alpha, in Dupuytren's palmar fascia when compared with control fascia. These endogenous prostaglandins may influence the contractile behavior of myofibroblasts in Dupuytren's disease to contribute to the pathobiology of this disorder.",The Journal of hand surgery,3225412,1988
Cytogenetic studies in Dupuytren contracture.,"Dupuytren contracture is a connective tissue disease mainly confined to Caucasians. It is characterized by nodular growth and proliferation of collagen in the palmar and plantar fascias. Autosomal dominance with variable penetrance is considered the most likely mode of inheritance. The goal of the present study was to examine the cytogenetics of this common benign neoplasia. Chromosome studies were performed on the nodular growth of eight patients with Dupuytren contracture, all of whom showed chromosome abnormalities that included numerical and structural clones, random numerical and structural aberrations, prophasing, and premature centromere separation. Numerical clones of trisomies 7 and/or 8, as well as some random structural aberrations, were considered to represent in vivo abnormalities, whereas most structural clones appeared likely to be the results of rapid and selective in vitro growth of particular cells. The disease process occurring in Dupuytren contracture was found to involve marked chromosome instability, as well as some in vivo clonal formation. Transverse fascial tissue, usually considered to be uninvolved in the disease process, unexpectedly showed all the same types of abnormalities as the nodular tissue. This indicates a more widespread distribution of disease in the tissues than previously suspected. The findings in the present study are similar to those in various malignant and benign types of tumorous growth and suggest the importance of further cytogenetic investigation into other conditions of benign growth.",American journal of human genetics,3414684,1988

[Results of surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture].,"Ninety-five Patients with Dupuytren's contracture, treated by partial (subtotal) aponeurectomy, have been evaluated retrospectively from various points of view. The immediate postoperative status and the results one to five years later were compared. The authors establish that Dupuytren's contracture can be treated with very favourable effect, but the good results deteriorate later due to recurrence. This deterioration remains temporarily unchanged in the second and third years, but the worsening continues till the end of the fifth year. The functional state shortly after the operation was 41% better than the preoperative one, becoming 18% worse after the fifth year, but even then was 22.6% better than the preoperative condition.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",3181828,1988
"Four related fibrosing diseases. When you find one, look for another.","Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren's contracture, aponeurotic plantar fibrosis, and knuckle pads are fibrosing diseases with many common features.

A simple inexpensive post-operative management regime following surgery for Dupuytren's contracture.,"A simple regime has been devised for the post-operative management of patients following surgery for Dupuytren's contracture; this includes splintage of the hand for two weeks and active and passive mobilisation by the patient according to precise instructions. Selective help was provided by minimal occupational therapy in 5 of 50 patients. The results of the method were assessed prospectively by subjective criteria and objective assessment by measuring the deformity of the finger joints, lateral and tip pinch and grasp and shear forces.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3171288,1988
Out-patient surgery for Dupuytren's disease under intravenous regional anaesthesia.,"During a six-month period, 55 operations for Dupuytren's contracture were performed on an out-patient basis. Intravenous regional anaesthesia was used in all cases, and the skin was closed primarily by Z-plasties. This method, which has not been published earlier, does not allow the surgeon to release the tourniquet before securing haemostasis. It is left to the patients to manage the post-operative elevation. No cases of post-operative haematoma occurred, and recovery of hand function was good in all cases. The method saves resources and is well-tolerated by patients.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3171287,1988
The long-term results of closed palmar fasciotomy in the management of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Twenty-three patients were reviewed an average of 5.3 years after a closed palmar fasciotomy for the correction of Dupuytren's contracture. Results suggest that this procedure is best suited to those whose contracture is mainly at the MP joint and that approximately 55% of such patients can expect the correction to be maintained for at least five years. In those patients with severe deformity affecting the PIP joint in addition to the MP joint, this may be a useful preliminary procedure, but is unlikely to be of any long term benefit.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3171286,1988

The reverse ulnar artery forearm island flap in hand surgery: 54 cases.,"The authors discuss their experience with the ulnar artery forearm island flap in 54 cases of hand surgery. They discuss its advantages over the radial island forearm flap and examine further technical possibilities in hand reconstruction, such as the compound flap. Although these reconstructive techniques do not have any sequelae, they involve the sacrifice of a major artery and should thus be used only in complex cases with very clear indications and as a last resort.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,3375354,1988
Dupuytren's disease of the foot in children; a report of three cases.,"Fibromatosis of the plantar fascia is a much less common occurrence than that of the palmar fascia and it is rarer still in children. It is essential to differentiate this entity from fibrosarcoma. In spite of its high incidence of local recurrence and the histological presence of mitotic figures, conservative resection is the treatment of choice. Recurrence following dermofasciectomy and skin grafting is less common than simple excision of the nodules in the fascia. Amputation should never be the treatment.",British journal of plastic surgery,3382858,1988
Dupuytren's contracture in an adolescent.,"Dupuytren's disease is a fibrotic process that can impair hand function by producing flexion contractures of the digits. The hypertrophic changes and contracture of the palmar fascia are frequently encountered in the geriatric population but can also occur in the adolescent age group. There is a definite genetic predisposition, and familial occurrences are common. Females of any age and males under age 40 are more prone to postoperative complications than other patients.",American family physician,3358339,1988

The distribution of unsulphated and sulphated glycosaminoglycans in palmar fascia from patients with Dupuytren's disease and healthy subjects.,"Eighty specimens from 20 patients with Dupuytren's disease and 7 biopsies of healthy palmar fascia were analysed for their glycosaminoglycan isomer patterns with a combined enzymatic/HPLC method. The diseased portions of palmar fascia tissue were characterized by elevated total glycosaminoglycans together with a relative increase in the sulphated fractions. The macroscopic stages of nodules, bands and unaffected tissue could be classified very well by multivariate statistical analysis on the basis of their glycosaminoglycan patterns. The biochemical analysis provided evidence of the pathological process even in those specimens that did not yet show any clinical symptoms of the disease.",Journal of clinical chemistry and clinical biochemistry.

Fine structural alterations of the palmar aponeurosis in Dupuytren's contracture. A combined scanning and transmission electronmicroscopic examination.,The authors examined the fine structural alterations of palmar aponeurosis in Dupuytren's contracture. Two types of the fibroblasts can be identified: classic fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. In the Dupuytren's tissue one fourth of all non-inflammatory cells were regarded as myofibroblasts. In the Dupuytren's aponeurosis the orientation of the thin and thick collagen fibers varied. The Paccini corpuscles were hypertrophised and around them compact collagen tissue was increased.,Zentralblatt fur allgemeine Pathologie u. pathologische Anatomie,3358315,1988
Histogenesis of Dupuytren's disease: an immunohistochemical study of 30 cases.,"Thirty-seven specimens from the hands of 30 patients with Dupuytren's disease were examined by light microscopy after immunohistochemical staining for the presence of desmin intermediate filaments. Results indicated that desmin-positive cells were present in the proliferative Dupuytren's nodules, and that the number of desmin-positive cells decreased significantly in the fibrous phase of the disease. Also, on the basis of the pattern of distribution of the desmin-positive cells around vessels, we postulate that the desmin-positive cells in Dupuytren's nodules were migrating perivascular smooth muscle cells from the vessel wall. The exact fate of these cells is uncertain, but we hypothesize that these displaced perivascular smooth muscle cells are capable of transforming into collagen-producing, desmin-negative myofibroblasts that form the cellular basis of Dupuytren's lesions.",The Journal of hand surgery,3351230,1988
Rheumatoid arthritis and Dupuytren's contracture.,"Of four patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Dupuytren's contracture, two were not aware of the presence of Dupuytren's contracture. When both diseases coexist, the presence of rheumatoid hand deformities, especially flexion and ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints, may mask the flexion deformity caused by Dupuytren's contracture. Careful clinical examination should rule out the presence of a pathologic fascial cord. When reconstructive surgery is indicated for the rheumatoid hand in the presence of advanced Dupuytren's contracture, staged surgery would be appropriate and reconstruction of Dupuytren's contracture should precede other surgery.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,3336640,1988
A ten years follow-up of the results of surgery for Dupuytren's disease. A study of fifty-eight cases.,"Fifty-eight patients (52 males and 6 females) operated on for Dupuytren contracture were examined by the same author with a more than ten year follow-up. At time of surgery the average was 55 years old. 69 hands (169 fingers) rated 4.33 according to the simplified Tubiana's score were treated by the same operative procedure: Mac Indoe's incision, digital Z plasty (if needed), subtotal fasciectomy and physiotherapy beginning 8 days postoperatively. At long term, recurrence appears for 49 hands (71%) one every two in the two first postoperative years, one out of five after five years. 24 of them were graded stage I. The recurrence appeared 14 times associated with an extension of the disease and the earlier, the higher was the initial stage. Some factors seem to be of a bad prognosis regarding recurrence: age (93% of recurrence under 50 years old) Ledderhose or Lapeyronie (100%) other associated diseases (Alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy) and severe preoperative stage. Subjective results are good: 45 patients are satisfied and only 3 underwent a second operation.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,3233038,1988
Ultrastructural and autoradiographic investigations of cell cultures derived from tendons or ligamentous material from patients with fibromatous disorders.,"Cell cultures were derived from tendons or ligamentous material from patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), Dupuytren's contracture (DP), tendopathia nodosa (TN) and hallux valgus (HV). The ultrastructure of the operation specimens as well as of the cell monolayers was investigated, using a floating sheet method in order to preserve both cell-to-cell contacts and the orientation of the monolayers. The histologic features of the tissues obtained in the operations were correlated with the ultrastructure of the cells in culture derived from these specimens. In DP, above all in the nodules, an activation of the capillary endothelium in the vicinity of myofibroblasts and mast cells was observed. In CTS the collagen fibrils varied extremely in diameter. In DP and TN biopsies a splicing process of helicoidly arranged fibrils could be seen. A disintegration of elastic fibers in the fibrillar and amorphous components was found in DP nodules, HV and TN tissues. Transitional forms between fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were observed not only in DP but also-though in a smaller percentage--in the cultures derived from the other patients. The cells showed organelles for active protein synthesis and transport. Autophagocytosis and the formation of multilamellated bodies took place in TN and HV cultures. In CTS, DP and TN cultures cells were connected via gap junctions. In some cultures, above all in those derived from CTS, monocilia were found. In CTS cultures the formation of intracellular collagen occurred. Growth parameters were rather low in HV cultures. PLmax (maximal pulse labelling index) values were higher in TN cultures than in DP and HV cultures. Plating efficiency (PE) values were higher in cultures derived from cell-rich and capillarized tissues than in biopsies with few cells.",Experimental cell biology,3229549,1988

[Dorsal Dupuytren's disease].,"Two different manifestations of the disease are discussed: hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint through mechanical fibrous contracture or through pathological involvement of the retinacular ligaments. Surgical correction is performed by transection of the contracted structures but this manifestation tends to be found in severe disease and thus to presage a poor prognosis. Dorsal localisations of the disease itself in the form of (1) knuckle pads when localized on the dorsal aspect of the PIP joint where they do not impair flexion, or (2) distal nodules situated dorsal to the extensor tendon and the IP joints and restricting the range of flexion. Surgical excision in group 2, when requested by patients, has enabled us to determine that the histological aspect is of Dupuytren's disease and that the post-operative course has been uneventful in our 12 operated cases.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,3190317,1988

Extracellular matrix-cytoskeletal connections at the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast (myofibroblast) in Dupuytren disease.,"The cellular basis of contracture of the palmar fascia in patients who have Dupuytren disease involves the generation of intracellular force and the transmission of this force to the surrounding tissue. A specialized cell, the myofibroblast, supposedly generates this intracellular force. Recently published studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the cytoskeleton of the myofibroblast contains non-muscle myosin and not smooth-muscle myosin, suggesting that it utilizes a non-muscle contractile system. In addition, these studies identified the extracellular glycoprotein fibronectin, not the basal-lamina-specific glycoprotein laminin, at the surface of myofibroblasts, suggesting that the transmission of the intracellular force to the surrounding tissue also occurs by a non-muscle mechanism. Because of the lack of proteins that are specific to smooth muscle in the specialized cell in Dupuytren disease, we prefer the term specialized contractile fibroblast to describe this type of cell. To determine the mechanism by which the intracellular force may be transmitted to the surrounding tissue, we examined the ultrastructure of the connection of the cytoskeleton of the specialized contractile fibroblast to the surrounding extracellular matrix. By electron microscopy, extracellular filamentous material was identified at the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast. These extracellular fibrils were found to be in close association with intracellular bundles of actin microfilaments, resulting in specialized transmembranous associations at the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast. Bundles of filamentous extracellular material were found to extend from the surface of the specialized contractile fibroblast, connecting it with the surrounding matrix and also with adjacent specialized contractile fibroblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Free radicals and Dupuytren's contracture.,"The concentration of substrate expressed as hypoxanthine capable of reacting with xanthine oxidase to release superoxide free radicals (O2-) was measured in control and Dupuytren's contracture palmar fascia. In Dupuytren's contracture palmar fascia the concentration of hypoxanthine was six times that of control and was greatest in &quot;nodular&quot; areas. Xanthine oxidase activity was also detected in Dupuytren's contracture palmar fascia. These results suggest a greater potential for hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase generated oxygen free radical formation in Dupuytren's contracture than in control palmar fascia. Production of free radicals may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture. The benefit of allopurinol in the management of Dupuytren's contracture and other fibrotic conditions may thus be explained, as allopurinol binds to xanthine oxidase and prevents release of free radicals.",British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),2825907,1987
Possible role of plasminogen activator content of the palmar nodules in recurrence of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Increased amounts of plasminogen activator enzymes were found in the large Dupuytren's nodules in the so-called active phase of the disease. A prospective study in 15 patients who had operations investigated possible relationships between fibrinolytic capacity of the palmar nodules (assessed by the fibrin plate method) and the recurrence of contracture. There were substantial analogies and suggestive connections with the results of previous electron microscopic studies. Combined with the presence of myofibroblasts, the high increase of plasminogen activator enzymes in the fascial nodules may be regarded as a predictive marker for possible recurrence after surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.",The Journal of hand surgery,3693826,1987
Dupuytren's disease in women: evaluation of long-term results after operation.,"A study of the long-term results after operation on 66 women (83 hands) with Dupuytren's disease showed that women are twice as likely as men to have a postoperative flare reaction. Why a flare reaction develops is uncertain. In this study, patients who had a carpal tunnel release at the time of operation for treatment of Dupuytren's disease or those who had an extensive fasciectomy, as opposed to removal of only the contracted tissue, were more apt to have a flare reaction. In addition, after operation, moderate or severe loss of finger flexion occurred in 35% of hands without a flare reaction and in 76% of those who had a flare reaction. This suggests that women having an operation for treatment of Dupuytren's disease are apt to have a worse result than men.",The Journal of hand surgery,3693825,1987
[Controlled healing in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by the McCash's technic].,"Results of a short series of cases, without statistical pretension, have shown that controlled cicatrisation during treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by open palm method appears to be obtained somewhat more rapidly and to be of better quality using an antiseptic rather than a greasy dressing.

Conservative surgery for Dupuytren's contracture.,The trend towards conservativism in the management of Dupuytren's contracture has resulted in less radical surgery than was previously advocated to release disabling contractures of the fingers. 38 cases of Dupuytren's contracture in the palm have been treated by Z-plasty of skin and underlying contracted band without fasciectomy. Proximal interphalangeal joint contractures were treated by fasciectomy and skin closure with Z-plasties as required. Only one of 16 patients reviewed after two years had evidence of recurrence. Skin compliance has been measured and a return to near-normal levels was found in all but the one patient with a recurrence.,"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3437199,1987
A review of attitudes to splintage in Dupuytren's contracture.,"A questionnaire on the use of splintage before and after operations for Dupuytren's contracture has been completed by 45 hand surgeons and ten hand therapists.

Dermofasciectomy and full-thickness grafts in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.,"We report a 16-year experience with full-thickness grafts to resurface defects created by releasing contractures of Dupuytren's disease. This technique was used in 68 patients with Dupuytren's contracture from 1970 to 1985. Follow-up of 36 hands of 24 patients averaged 3.9 years postoperatively. There was no recurrent disease in the palms and digits that were covered with the full-thickness grafts. The incidence of extension outside the grafts was 8%. The area of full-thickness grafting covered most of the width of the palm, an extension of Gonzalez's technique, which was presented in 1970.",The Journal of hand surgery,3309018,1987
Dupuytren's contracture: wound irrigation to prevent hematoma.,"Hematoma is one of many complications that can follow surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. In this article, along with a discussion of previously used methods, a technique developed to prevent postoperative palmar hematoma is reviewed. The technique consists of inserting a polyethylene tube into the surgical wound prior to closure and then irrigating the wound with cold Ringer's solution at the rate of approximately 75 cc/hr for 24-36 hours postoperatively. The review involved 101 patients with 124 procedures, 76 of which were performed using the new technique. The incidence of hematoma in the patients without irrigation was 6.3%, while that in the patients with irrigation was 0.0%. No deleterious side effects of this technique were detected.",Orthopaedic review,3331193,1987
Calcification in Dupuytren's disease: a report of two cases.,Two cases are presented of calcification within Dupuytren's tissue.

"Dupuytren's contracture, alcohol consumption, and chronic liver disease.","This prospective study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and its relationship with possible causes, especially alcohol consumption and chronic liver disease. Four hundred thirty-two consecutively hospitalized patients were examined for evidence of DC. They were divided into five groups based on the following clinical, biologic, and histologic criteria: alcoholic cirrhosis (89 patients), noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease (55 patients), chronic alcoholism without liver disease (46 patients), nonalcoholic chronic liver disease (68 patients), and a control group (174 patients). The prevalence of DC in these five groups of patients was 32.5%, 22%, 28%, 6%, and 12%, respectively; the prevalence of DC was higher in patients with cirrhotic or noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease (25.5%) than it was in patients with nonalcoholic liver disease (6%), but it was not significantly different in alcoholic patients with or without liver disease. The relationship between DC and age, sex, manual labor, previous hand injuries, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking was assessed by univariate and logistic regression methods. Nine variables were significantly different in patients with or without DC: age, sex, manual labor, previous hand injuries, diabetes mellitus, daily alcohol consumption, duration of alcohol consumption, total alcohol consumption, and duration of cigarette smoking. In our patients, variables that could explain DC were, in decreasing order, age, total alcohol consumption, sex (male), and previous hand injuries. In alcoholic patients, these variables were age and previous hand injuries; in nonalcoholic patients, these variables were age and cigarette smoking. These results emphasize the high prevalence of DC in alcoholic patients and the absence of a correlation between DC and chronic liver disease. Age and alcohol consumption are the best explanatory variables of DC in hospitalized patients.",Archives of internal medicine,3592873,1987

Association of limited joint mobility with Dupuytren's contracture in diabetes mellitus.,"Limited joint mobility is a relatively recent addition to the list of other well known rheumatic disorders that may be associated with diabetes mellitus. In our study of 109 patients with diabetes, a higher prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture was found compared to nondiabetic subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.1). An association between limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture was shown. Patients with diabetes with Dupuytren's contracture showed no difference compared to those without Dupuytren's contracture with regard to sex, insulin dosage, metabolic control and presence of shoulder capsulitis. Limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture may be associated with retinopathy.",The Journal of rheumatology,3305932,1987
"[A histochemical study of acid glycosaminoglycans on normal and pathological cartilage, ligaments and several other connective tissues].","Histochemical estimation of acid glycosaminoglycan was critically re-evaluated, using the meniscus, intervertebral disc, ossified yellow ligament, ganglion, Dupuytren's fascia and several other tissues. Each tissue was stained with toluidine blue, alcian blue, high iron diamine, low iron diamine, aldehyde fuchsin and dialyzed iron-ferrocyanide. Digestion techniques for GAG were used in these staining methods, and the effects of protease inhibitors (PI) on digestion were also examined. In this study, the optimal temperature for digestion with Streptomyces hyaluronidase was between 37 degrees C and 43 degrees C, which varied according to the tissue examined. The addition of PI seemed necessary because the enzymatic treatment without PI resulted in an excessive decrease of staining. Protease-free chondroitinase ABC, which did not excessively decrease staining results, was found to be more useful than chondroitinase ABC without PI.",Nihon Seikeigeka Gakkai zasshi,2445881,1987
Dupuytren's contracture studied with monoclonal antibodies to connective tissue differentiation antigens.,"Seventeen patients with Dupuytren's contracture underwent partial fasciectomy, and frozen tissue sections from the involved palmar fascia were prepared for binding studies with hybridoma-derived murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) recognizing connective tissue differentiation antigens. The two MoAb used were both generated using human sarcomas as immunizing agents, 23H7 known to bind to an antigen shared by selected sarcomas and carcinomas but not normal adult tissues except a subset of granulocytes, and 12C9 shown to recognize a common fibroblastic marker. MoAb 23H7 was discovered to bind to a subset of fibroblasts within the lesions of six of 17 patients with Dupuytren's disease. Occasionally it immunostained a single cell population associated with tissue granulocytes dispersed in the surroundings of the lesions. MoAb 12C9 was found to be expressed in only 12 of 17 specimens prepared from involved lesions from Dupuytren's disease. It is suggested that fibroblasts from selected patients with Dupuytren's contracture express a novel antigen, defined by MoAb 23H7, previously shown to be associated with human sarcomas and other neoplasia. The other fibroblast marker which is defined by MoAb 12C9 and known to be a common connective tissue antigen, is only occasionally expressed in lesions involved with this disease. Though additional markers associated with Dupuytren's contracture remain to be defined, the MoAb, capable of defining connective tissue differentiation markers, reported in this study may serve as new immunological probes for immunodissecting this syndrome into subsets of diseases which may better define the variety of clinical patterns presented by patients.",Clinical and experimental immunology,3308216,1987
Salvage of severe recurrent Dupuytren's contracture of the ring and small fingers.,"Severe recurrent digital Dupuytren's contracture, with pseudomotor changes and inadequate palmar tissue, is often treated with amputation. In this study, 11 patients had 14 proximal interphalangeal joint fusions with shortening done for salvage of recurrent Dupuytren's rather than amputation. Indications for operation were pseudomotor changes, severe palmar fibrosis, previous operations, and a flexion contracture of greater than 70 degrees.",The Journal of hand surgery,3559089,1987
[Dupuytren's contracture as a concomitant disease in diabetes mellitus].,"100 randomized diabetic patients were examined for the occurrence of Dupuytren's palmar contractions and for possible relations to the usual chronic diabetic complications, to metabolic control and to social and environmental factors. The incidence of the Dupuytren's palmar contraction in the total diabetic population was 42%. Contractions were most frequent on the tendons of the third and fourth fingers with a preponderance of the right side. The relative frequency of the Dupuytren's palmar contraction increased with age and the duration of diabetes mellitus. There were no relations to the chronic diabetic complications or the metabolic control. In conclusion Dupuytren's palmar contraction appears to be an age-dependent, but not specifical diabetic process, although it appears to be accelerated by diabetes mellitus.",Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),3590817,1987

Stenosing tenosynovitis in Dupuytren's contracture.,Patients with symptoms of stenosing tenosynovitis and clinical evidence of overlying Dupuytren's contracture were treated with localized total fasciectomy through multiple Y-V plasties and the excision of the A1 pulley of the affected digit. At operation the stenosing tenosynovitis could be separated into two categories--patients with external compression from contracting vertical septa or patients in whom the tendon constriction appeared unrelated to the overlying fascial disease.,The Journal of hand surgery,3805648,1987
Impressions of Dupuytren's disease.,"Of the 450 cases seen in may practice (1946-76), 50 cases were rejected for any kind of treatment for various reasons. In an additional 50 cases, fasciotomy was done at a V.A. facility. This procedure was abandoned in favor of bandectomy. Amputation of useless fingers (usually the acutely contracted small finger) was done in 5 cases at the patient's request to remove this occupational hazard. In the remaining 350 cases of primary fasciectomy, there were 2 cases of accidental severance of the digital nerves in the finger, which were repaired at once. These occurred before I began to use the zigzag incision which provides excellent exposure of the N.V. bundles ensuring their safety. With regard to skin slough, when Z-plasty was used early in this series, there was an occasional slough of the acutely angled tip of the transposed flap. After I began to use the zigzag volar incision, and doubtful skin edges were trimmed away, there was no skin necrosis. Antibiotics were used briefly in a few cases where there was intertrigo with skin maceration at acutely flexed PIP joints. The incidence of seroma, hematoma and infection was zero.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,3449003,1987

Follow-up checks were made on 35 patients, the average postoperative period amounting to 41 months. Rates of recurrence were 33 per cent, following partial palmaraponeurectomy, but only five per cent, following total removal. No difference was established regarding postoperative complications.

Oestrogen and progesterone hormone receptors in Dupuytren's disease.,"Dupuytren's disease is associated with alcoholism and chronic liver disease, conditions frequently associated with deranged steroid hormone metabolism. The possible influence of endogenous sex steroid hormones on the development of Dupuytren's disease has therefore been investigated. An analysis of diseased palmar fascia for oestrogen and progesterone receptors was undertaken in fifteen patients. Hormone specific receptors were not found in the palmar fascia of our patients with Dupuytren's disease, thus suggesting that other mechanisms or factors contribute to the pathogenesis of this fibrotic process.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3794501,1986

Can progression of Dupuytren's contracture be recognized as an accident sequela?].,"A healthy nineteen year-old soldier suffered a contusion of the distal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. A flexion contracture ensued. Histologic examination of the excised tissue revealed Dupuytren's contracture. Despite several more operations, progressive Dupuytren's contracture made it necessary to amputate the little finger at the level of the proximal phalanx. This was accepted for disability purposes as an injury acquired during military service.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",3744141,1986
The cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix of the Dupuytren's disease &quot;myofibroblast&quot;: an immunofluorescence study of a nonmuscle cell type.,"The cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix of myofibroblasts in nodules from Dupuytren's diseased palmar fascia were examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Primary antibodies used as probes of these tissue compartments were directed against (1) smooth muscle myosin, (2) nonmuscle myosin--components of the cytoplasmic contractile apparatus in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells, respectively, (3) laminin, and (4) fibronectin--extracellular glycoproteins mediating cell-matrix attachment in smooth muscle and nonmuscle fibroblastic cells, respectively. The Dupuytren's nodular cells stained for nonmuscle myosin and fibronectin but not for smooth muscle myosin or laminin; this indicated that, at the level of biochemical differentiation, these cells are a nonmuscle type. Staining for fibronectin between nodular cells was dramatically increased over that seen between fibroblasts of the normal palmar fascia. Because of the non-muscle nature of the distinctive contractile cell type of the Dupuytren's nodule, we suggest that the term myofibroblast should be considered a misnomer when applied to this pathogenic cell type.",The Journal of hand surgery,3519746,1986
Prevention of complications in hand therapy.,"Basic principles stress that the injury or surgery is not to be extended through complications resulting from a failure to control edema, poor wound care, improper splinting, or forceful exercise. Prevention of these problems in hand therapy is discussed. Close rapport between surgeon, patient, and therapist is most important to support and motivate the patient. If that motivation is demolished or even impaired, the entire course of surgery and therapy may be complicated or impaired.",Hand clinics,3517021,1986
Dupuytren's contracture and alcohol.,"Reported alcohol consumption was quantified and scored by a validated questionnaire administered by an interviewer to 64 patients (10 female) with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) before hand surgery and to 89 controls (44 female) admitted for other hand or foot surgery. Serum urate (SUA), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and mean red cell volume (MCV) were measured on admission. Thirteen of 54 men with DC reported current daily alcohol intake of 40 g or more compared with one of 45 male controls (p = 0.0001). Two of 10 women with DC (but none of 44 controls) admitted consuming at least 40 g alcohol daily (p = 0.03). MCV was higher in men (but not women) with DC than in controls (p less than 0.0005). Current alcohol consumption score of patients with DC correlated with SUA (r = 0.308, p less than 0.05), MCV (r = 0.44, p less than 0.01), and GGT (r = 0.54, p much less than 0.001) on admission.

Fibrin/fibrinogen and fibrinolytic activity of the palmar fascia in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Considering the proved interaction of fibrin with fibroblasts and the seemingly decisive role of structural and functional changes (&quot;modulation&quot;) of these cells in the evolution of Dupuytren's contracture, research has been carried out in order to investigate the fibrinolytic capacity and the possible presence of fibrin/fibrinogen in the palmar fascia of subjects operated upon for Dupuytren's Disease. Fibrin/fibrinogen were detected by a direct immunofluorescence technique and fibrinolytic activity was assessed by a fibrin plate method. A remarkable decrease of fibrinolytic activity and the presence of fibrin/fibrinogen were observed in small nodules in the early stage of disease, whereas large nodules showed a high amount of plasminogen activator enzymes. Small nodules seem to form and increase by progressive adhesion of fibroblasts to the polymerizing fibrin, while high fibrinolytic activity of large nodules probably results from &quot;modulation&quot; of many fibroblasts into contractile myofibroblasts and could therefore be considered as a biochemical sign of the evolutionary phase of Dupuytren's contracture.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3958550,1986
Antibodies to collagen types I-VI in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Sera from 16 patients with Dupuytren's contracture were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to native and denatured human collagen types I, II, III, IV, V and VI. IgG antibody to at least one collagen type was found in 11/16 (69%) of these patients, compared with 27/96 (28%) normal adult blood donor controls. The prevalence of antibody to denatured type II collagen was raised, and although there was no overall increase in HLA-DR4 compared with a control population, this antibody was associated with HLA-DR4 in this patient group.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3485693,1986

Evaluation of deformities in Dupuytren's disease.,"The method for classification of Dupuytren's disease, established by R. Tubiana, J. Michon and J.M. Thomine, which translates ray by ray the localization and intensity of lesions, was partly modified and completed. These modifications give a more precise evaluation of the thumb and first web space deformations, indicate the skin's state, eventual post-operative stiffness, and provide numbers which can be used in computers. The pre-operative classification described in the first half of this article is very simple and practical, and may be used effectively by all physicians who are presented with Dupuytren's disease. Supplementary indicators in the second half of the paper provide further precision which permits objective judgement of operative results.

Surgery of Dupuytren's disease: a review of the open palm method.,"Experience with 49 cases of Dupuytren's disease treated by the open palm method and followed for an average of 5 years is reported. This method permits excision of the involved fascia while minimizing early postoperative morbidity associated with the surgical management of this condition. There were no cases of wound necrosis, hematoma, or infection with this technique, and all wounds closed spontaneously within 3 to 5 weeks. Long-term follow-up, however, revealed a significant rate of recurrence (32%) and extension (48%), as well as flexion loss at one or more joints in 41% of involved hands. While helpful in the early care of these patients, the open palm method does not modify the long-term results in Dupuytren's disease, which is a pervasive condition without simple surgical solution.",The Journal of hand surgery,3944435,1986
[Functional anatomy of the lst web space].,"In order to ensure the efficacy of several types of grips, the first web space and the function of contra-opposition, i.e. spread of the thumb from the rest of the hand, must be normal. The anatomic elements that contribute to this function are as follows: the trapezometacarpal joint, the range of motion which may be limited if cartilage lesions, osteophytosis or ligament contractures are present; the first dorsal interosseous, the adductor pollicis muscles and the fascial clefts between them. Contracture of these fasciae, usually ischemic in nature, may cause contracture of the first web space ; the neurovascular elements, which are implicated in paralysis and Volkmann's contracture ; the teguments of the web space and thenar aponeurotic system in which cord-like thickening (as in Dupuytren's contracture), accidental or surgical incisions, may result in severe contracture of the first web space. Involvement of these anatomic structures may be isolated or, more often, associated. Surgery must be adapted to each case, which means taking painstaking care in the evaluation of these factors by thorough clinical examination, and completed by adequate radiograms.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,3767503,1986
"[Raynaud's syndrome, Dupuytren's disease, force of prehension and sensitivity of the hand. Study of age-related changes].","The prevalence of Raynaud's syndrome, of arterial calcifications and of Dupuytren's contracture was studied in 155 subjects of both sexes, decade by decade from 20 to 90 years. Moreover the force of prehension and two-point discrimination were measured separately. The prevalence of Raynaud's syndrome was 9% independent of variations in age or of sex. The prevalence of Dupuytren's contracture was equally 9% but only subjects over 60 years old (and one woman) were affected. The force of prehension diminished significantly with age, more in women than in men, and more in older patients presenting arthritis. Lastly, tactile sensibility decreased with age but individual variations were important.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,3767501,1986
Resection of the palmaris longus tendon in surgery for Dupuytren's contracture.,"The present investigation presents preliminary results of the operative method, where resection of the palmaris longus tendon is combined with regional fasciectomy in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. This procedure was developed to prevent recurrence which has been the biggest problem in the treatment regardless the surgical methods employed. The investigation included 70 consecutive patients (80 hands) treated for Dupuytren's contracture; the mean follow-up time was 47 months (62 patients). 96% of the recurrences occurred during the first two years. 42 hands were treated with regional fasciectomy and in these 18 recurrences (43%) were observed. Recurrences were found only in 23% (6/26) of the patients in whom the palmaris longus tendon was eliminated. Following resection of the palmaris longus tendon recurrences manifested themselves mainly in the fingers in the nodular cutaneously fixed form. From the promising results and absence of side effects of resection of the palmaris longus tendon the procedure can be recommended combined with surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.",Annales chirurgiae et gynaecologiae,3740784,1986

The pathobiology of Dupuytren's contracture: effects of prostaglandins on myofibroblasts.,The in vitro response of myofibroblasts to prostaglandins F2alpha (a vasoconstrictor) and E2 (a vasodilator) were evaluated in specimens obtained from the Dupuytren's nodules of 12 patients. Fibroblasts from four control samples of palmar fascia were similarly tested. This study demonstrated the ability of prostaglandin F2alpha to induce significant contraction of myofibroblasts. Prostaglandin E2 was noted to cause significant relaxation of myofibroblasts. The contractile/relaxation responses of control fibroblasts to these prostaglandins were minimal.,The Journal of hand surgery,3456001,1986
The use of skin grafts in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Digital contractures caused by Dupuytren's disease can best be treated by open fasciotomy plus excision of all overlying involved skin and replacement by full-thickness skin grafts.

[Cortical hyperostosis of the pisiform bone in stage I Dupuytren contracture in chronic alcoholics].,The author examined the carpalia of 40 male alcoholics suffering from Stage I of Dupuytren's contracture. In four subjects he observed a cortical hyperostosis of the right pisiform bone on the tangential films. The hyperostosis can be ascribed to the ethanol-induced hyperlipoproteinemia type II/B. The lipoids leaving the vascular paths infiltrate the connective tissue capsule of the pisiform bone and stimulate the formation of osteoblasts at the border between bone and soft tissue. The ossification must be regarded as enteropathic hyperostosis.,Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete,3832681,1985

The proximal interphalangeal joint in Dupuytren's disease.,"In one hundred patients with Dupuytren's disease, one hundred and fifty-four operations were performed. The average pre-operative proximal interphalangeal joint contracture was 42 degrees and the average percentage improvement in proximal interphalangeal joint extension at post-operative review was 41%. Fourteen amputations were performed (9.1%). The primary deformity is caused by disease involvement of the palmar fascial structures. Secondary changes may prevent correction of the deformity despite excision of the contracted fascia. The anatomy of the joint is reviewed together with the primary and secondary mechanisms of joint contracture in Dupuytren's disease. Arthrodesis, osteotomy of the proximal phalanx and joint replacement are considered as alternatives to amputation when a systematic surgical approach fails to correct the flexion contracture.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",4078465,1985

[Proliferation and 3H proline incorporation of cells of palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren disease)].,Proliferation and 3H-proline incorporation were studied autoradiographically in cells of Dupuytren's fibromatosis. It was observed that cells in the fibromatous tissue only exhibit a minimal proliferation rate. Increased 3H-thymidine labelling was found in vascular and perivascular cells. The finding may indicate that cells of perivascular areas contribute to the formation of the nodules. 3H-proline labelling was pronounced over cells of the fibromatous tissue leading to the assumption that these cells are highly metabolic.,Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie,4082789,1985
Quantification of early subclinical limited joint mobility in diabetes mellitus.,"Limited joint mobility (LJM) has been described in juvenile diabetic patients by Rosenbloom et al.; similar abnormalities are also present in adult diabetes. This modification may be associated with a high risk of microvascular complications. We tested the use of a goniometer in measuring subclinical joint limitation in 50 adult diabetic patients without overt, i.e., clinically evident, LJM as described by these authors. This diabetic population was compared with 118 nondiabetic adult controls. We found significant changes in hand mobility between the two groups for wrist flexion and extension of the 3rd and 5th fingers (P less than 0.001). Age was correlated to wrist flexion, wrist extension, and proximal interphalangeal flexion of the little finger. Wrist extension correlated with duration of diabetes (r = -0.37, P less than 0.01). Heavy manual activities significantly limited all motions except wrist and 5th finger metacarpophalangeal flexion. Early systematic examination by goniometry may prove to be a sensitive, quantitative, and inexpensive way of detecting joint stiffness at an early stage.",Diabetes care,4042798,1985
NA,"The incidence of Sudeck-like complications after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture is discussed. In a series of 209 operations for Dupuytren's contracture some complications were observed in 26 cases. In 12 patients these complications could not be precisely explained. In the author's opinion they may illustrate the creation of a nerve-irritating source within the operative field. In order to avoid these complications a two-stage operation was proposed, especially for severe contractures in elderly patients. A preliminary fasciotomy relieves most of symptoms of the disease and may also serve as a so-called tissue test for eventual more radical procedures. The observation of 42 patients with severe contractures so treated confirms the usefulness of the method.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",4007639,1985

The preparations comprise the entire soft tissue covering (skin, fat and aponeurosis). The scanning electron microscope enables a three dimensional examination of the surface of the collagen fibers. The following results were obtained: In the region of the skin contraction or the node: There is a displacement and atrophy of the fat layers by the proliferated and thickened connective tissue. The transitions between the various layers are obliterated. The collagen fibers perpendicular to the skin show massive cross-linking and thickening. The pathologically altered aponeurosis shows a variable morphology: the collagen bundles display major variations in diameter and structure.

The hand complications of Colles' fractures.,"Two hundred and thirty-five patients with displaced Colles' fractures were followed to union, and 209 patients to six months, specifically searching for hand pathology. The incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome was seventeen per cent at three months and twelve per cent at six months. The patients with the syndrome were significantly older and their fractures showed significantly greater residual dorsal angulation. Sixteen patients developed Dupuytren's disease between three and six months, when the incidence was eleven per cent. These patients were significantly older and had average fractures and anatomical results. All cases were mild, with only two contractures. Twenty-one patients were reviewed at a mean of 20.7 months post-fracture, when no case had significantly progressed.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",3998585,1985
Cultured myofibroblasts: a useful model to study wound contraction and pathological contracture.,"From both human and animal tissues, myofibroblasts can be successfully cultured in vitro through multiple passages. As compared with cultured fibroblasts from control tissues, early passage myofibroblasts have slower growth cycles, as is typical of highly differentiated cells. Also in early passage, differences between myofibroblasts and fibroblasts in tissue culture in vivo can be preserved. Late passage animal studies suggest dedifferentiation in both morphology and growth cycle rate. As indicated by our data, which have been discussed in detail in our previous investigations, we believe that further studies may help to define how such dedifferentiation occurs and may determine ways to do so clinically. However, such control attempts must take into account the heterogeneity of myofibroblast and fibroblast populations which these studies have identified.",Annals of plastic surgery,3888033,1985
Lesions of digital arteries in Dupuytren's disease. A study of twelve cases.,"Twelve cases of histologically examined digital collateral arteries severed accidentally during surgery for Dupuytren's disease are presented. All arteries were repaired immediately after specimen retrieval for histological examination. Only one artery had a normal structure; 11 cases showed subendothelial fibrosis while two arteries thrombosed. These changes might account for the confusion of these arteries with adhesions and might explain their severance. Typically the zone involved was the distal part of the palm, in which the neurovascular bundle twists around the spiral cord.

The extensor apparatus in Dupuytren's disease.,"If we study the secondary changes in the extensor mechanism we can see changes at each of the three joint levels which are responsible for incomplete correction of the deformity after apparently adequate surgery on the palmar aspect. At the DIP level the flexion may not be restored until tenotomy of this secondarily contracted extensor tendon is performed. At the PIP level the middle slip may be used as a &quot;lively splint&quot; capable of progressive post-operative straightening of this joint if tenotomy over the middle phalanx is used. At the MP joint of the little finger ulnar subluxation of the extensor tendons may produce persistent MP flexion although passively correctable, and relocation of the extensors at this level may occasionally be indicated to correct this persisting disability.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,4015238,1985

Intralesional steroid injections may represent an alternative to surgery in patients with plantar fibromatosis or Dupuytren's contractures.,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,3973122,1985
The isolated digital cord in Dupuytren's contracture: anatomy and clinical significance.,"This article describes the isolated occurrence of Dupuytren's pathologic fascial cords within digits of the hand. Thirty-seven cords were found in 32 patients with nearly half (45.6%) occurring in digits other than the small finger. Almost all patients (97.3%) had other clinical evidence of Dupuytren's disease. Cords were either single (83.8%) or double (16.2%) and originated from the periosteum at the base of the proximal phalanx in conjunction with adjacent ligaments and intrinsic tendons. They proceeded in an oblique direction to displace and then cross the neurovascular bundles before inserting on the bone and/or flexor tendon sheath of the middle phalanx. The average loss of extension of the proximal interphalangeal joint that resulted from these cords was 46 degrees, and surgical excision of the involved cords resulted in an average improvement of 24 degrees (53%).",The Journal of hand surgery,3968392,1985
Dupuytren disease.,"The recent increased interest in Dupuytren disease by basic scientists as well as clinicians has led to extensive investigations into the pathophysiology and etiology of this complicated condition. Our present knowledge of the basic scientific aspects of the disease, as well as methods of management, have been summarized in this chapter. Answers being sought in Dupuytren disease will certainly go a long way into solving problems of wound healing. However, until then, the methods of treatment of Dupuytren disease will remain varied, and unexpectedly poor results will still crop up all too frequently. At present the best defense against this is to pay particular attention to the anatomic variations in the disease, perform meticulous surgical procedures, and supervise careful postoperative management.",Surgery annual,3883547,1985

[Side effects of antiepileptic therapy. Study of 197 cases].,"A study of 197 epileptic outpatients consecutively observed by one Neurologist allowed a prospective study of the side effects of antiepileptic drugs. This study shows essentially that a clinical improvement comparable to that generally reported can be obtained with side effects limited in their number and intensity. The main principle is the routine search of these effects which are not always spontaneously mentioned by the patients, especially intellectual slowness and loss of sexual activity. The detection of the side effects through history and physical examination is far more fruitful than are plasma concentrations of drugs which can be doubly misleading: some plasma concentrations lower than recognized therapeutical levels are efficient however while others are higher and nevertheless necessary and well tolerated. Among the side effects specific to certain antiepileptic drugs, shoulder-hand syndrome due to phenobarbital was noted in 10 per cent of the cases. Furthermore, the frequency of scapulo-humeral periarthritis was significantly higher in the epileptic group than in the controls. Dupuytren's disease was less frequent (8 per cent) and the difference with the controls was not significant. Among the non-specific side effects, nystagmus is a somewhat useful sign in treatments by phenytoin but as with drugs dosages, it must be weighed within the whole clinical picture.",Revue neurologique,3003874,1985

Histocompatibility antigen patterns in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Thirty-seven consecutive patients with Dupuytren's Contracture were investigated by tissue typing techniques to ascertain their HLA--A, B, C and DR antigen status. Whilst no definite HLA antigen was found in association with this disease, at least one possibly significant pattern of HLA DR antigens was found in these patients. This finding was also noted in patients with scleroderma, and the scleroderma-like syndrome induced by vinyl chloride exposure.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",6334711,1984
Dupuytren type fibromatoses. A clinicopathologic study of 62 cases.,"This clinicopathologic study concerns 62 patients with one of the Dupuytren type fibromatoses. Of the 62 patients, 42 had the lesion in the palm (palmar fibromatosis), 12 in the sole (plantar fibromatosis), 2 in the penis (penile fibromatosis), and 6 in the ectopic locations, the dorsal aspect of the hand in 3 patients, the dorsum of the fingers in 2, and the forearm in 1. The clinically palpable nodules were histologically classified into those of the following three phases, according to LUCK'S classification: proliferative phase (27), involutional phase (23), and residual phase (12). In addition to fibroblastic proliferation, the lesion of the proliferative phase exhibited vascular features consisting of one or more layers of cells with oval nuclei around the vessels within the nodule. In the lesions of the late proliferative and involutional phase, the intracytoplasmic fine filaments were visible in cells compatible with myofibroblasts by Masson's trichrome stain. The nuclei of the elemental fibroblasts in the same phases were often crossed transversely by one or more fine basophilic lines.",Acta pathologica japonica,6507097,1984

[Fibronectin in Dupuytren contracture].,"The distribution of fibronectin in the palmar aponeurosis of patients with Dupuytren's contracture was compared with that of normal controls, using an immunofluorescent technique. The tissues were also investigated with type-specific anticollagen antisera (anti-type I and anti-type III collagen). Tissues from Dupuytren's contracture patients showed intense fibronectin fluorescence in the whole range studied. Collagen fibre bundles are characterized by a peripherally increased fibronectin concentration. Type I collagen is uniformly distributed, while type III collagen also seems to be enriched around the thickened fibre bundles.","Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",6386626,1984
The incidence of Dupuytren's disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Some conditions commonly associated with Dupuytren's disease are well-known. No attention has been paid to conditions with a significantly low incidence of Dupuytren's.

NA,"The empirical observation that Dupuytren's Contracture does not recur beneath a skin graft is applied as a means of controlling recurrent Dupuytren's Disease. In those patients with a strong inherited diathesis to the production of Dupuytren's Contracture, recurrence may occur or even by anticipated, and the placement of a skin graft strategically at a flexion crease is shown to act as a 'firebreak' between areas of potential flare-up of recurrent Dupuytren's Disease.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery,6380478,1984
Dupuytren's contracture: a comparative study of fasciectomy and dermofasciectomy in one hundred patients.,"This study reviews one hundred patients with Dupuytren's disease treated surgically by the Derby Hand Unit between January 1975 and September 1981. One hundred and twenty-eight operations were assessed with a follow-up period from nine months to ninety months, average thirty-eight months. In thirty-five patients the overlying skin was excised and replaced by a full-thickness skin graft (dermofasciectomy). The remaining patients were treated by fasciectomy without skin excision. The overall recurrence rate after surgery was found to be 46.5%. However skin excision and replacement following fasciectomy prevented any appreciable, if not all recurrence of Dupuytren's tissue. The function of the hand was assessed with regard to the improvement in flexion contracture; ability to flex the finger to the distal palmar crease; sensibility of the replaced skin; time to return to work and full activity. It was concluded that skin replacement did not jeopardize hand function.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",6379077,1984

Diabetes mellitus in the aetiology of Dupuytren's disease.,"In controlled clinical studies of adult diabetics a 42% incidence of signs of Dupuytren's disease was found. The incidence was highest in the older patients with a longer history of diabetes, but was not related to the severity of the diabetes. The features of Dupuytren's disease in the diabetics has a distinctive pattern, being more severe in men than women and, compared with controls, having a radial shift towards the middle finger. The disease was mild and of benign prognosis, rarely needing operation. In a further study, 13% of patients with Dupuytren's disease were found to have a raised blood glucose level. The question is posed as to whether the biochemical disturbance causes the Dupuytren's disease or whether the pattern of inheritance predisposes to both Dupuytren's disease and diabetes.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume,6725338,1984
Biochemical studies on the collagen of the palmar aponeurosis affected with Dupuytren's disease.,"The palmar aponeurosis of patients affected with Dupuytren's disease was examined for collagen characteristics with regard to extractability, polymorphism, and posttranslational modifications, and the results were compared with those from normal subjects. The increased proportion of type III collagen relative to type I collagen in the affected tissue confirmed the previous findings in this disease. A slight but significant increase in a ratio of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine to galactosylhydroxylysine in the Dupuytren's tissue may be interpreted by the increase in the content of type III collagen. The affected tissue contained increased amounts of dihydroxylysinonorleucine as the reducible cross-link of collagen. These data support the view that Dupuytren's tissue contains collagen resembling that in granulation and embryonic tissues. Pyridinoline was shown to occur in normal and affected aponeurosis. No change in its content suggests that this cross-link is not involved in the pathogenesis of contracture in this disease.",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,6740656,1984
Growth dynamics of cultured myofibroblasts from human breast cancer and nonmalignant contracting tissues.,"Myofibroblasts were successfully grown in tissue culture from the connective tissue stroma of three human breast adenocarcinomas. These cells had slower growth kinetics than fibroblasts from normal human dermis, as did myofibroblasts from two granulating wounds. Electron microscopy of breast cancer slices and tissue cultures of these specimens confirmed the presence of myofibroblasts in both. In early passages, the specificity of carcinoma-derived myofibroblast growth kinetics is preserved. The exact role of myofibroblasts in breast cancer, whether helping or hindering tumor growth, remains undetermined.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,6324265,1984
Some observations on knuckle pads.,"Although knuckle pads are histologically similar to the palmar nodules in Dupuytren's Disease, they do not produce contraction. By considering the anatomical situation of the knuckle pad overlying the joint line and comparing it with a unique case of a dorsal nodule occurring between the joint lines, an explanation is profferred for this lack of contraction by knuckle pads. That contraction in the extensor mechanism was produced by the nodule between the joint lines is used to support further the &quot;extrinsic&quot; hypothesis of the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's Disease.","Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)",6707508,1984

Microvascular changes in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Previous studies of certain fibrotic lesions (hypertrophic scar, keloid, pseudotendon) have revealed pervasive microvascular occlusion. Lowered oxygen tension is considered to be a stimulus to excessive collagen production and, hence, the scar. Because its characteristics are similar to those of other lesions, Dupuytren's contracture appeared to be a good model in which to confirm the presence of occluded microvessels. Six cases were examined by light, electron, and polarizing microscopy. Most of the microvessels from the precontracture band area throughout the periphery of the body of the nodules were occluded by a bulging of the endothelial cells into the lumen. The microvessels were surrounded by extensive layers of basal laminae. The nodules were essentially avascular. The presence of another fibrotic lesion in which pervasive microvascular occlusion occurs is suggestive of an underlying biologic principle concerning the generation of all fibrotic lesions.",The Journal of hand surgery,6693745,1984
Fasciectomy and Dupuytren's disease: a comparison between the open-palm technique and wound closure.,"An analysis of 153 patients treated surgically for Dupuytren's disease is presented. One hundred fifteen patients were treated with the closed-palm technique, while 38 patients were treated with the open-palm technique. The groups were comparable in terms of preoperative metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joint involvement, as well as the total number of rays involved. The patients were analyzed in terms of average pre- and post-operative total active motion (TAM) in the digital joints. The patients in the closed-palm group had a 10% improvement in TAM surgery, while those in the open-palm group had a 17% improvement (p less than 0.05). The complication rate in the closed-palm group was 19% and in the open-palm group, 8%. There were no hematomas in the open-palm group and no infections in either group. In a later follow-up of 103 patients who could be contacted, 33 of the 78 closed-palm group showed residual contracture (42%), while five of the 25 open-palm group were similarly affected (20%).",The Journal of hand surgery,6693744,1984

Dupuytren's disease: comparative growth dynamics and morphology between cultured myofibroblasts (nodule) and fibroblasts (cord).,"The excised palmar fascia of 11 patients with Dupuytren's disease was separated clinically into nodules and cords. Myofibroblasts were seen by light and electron microscopy in each of the nodules, but the cords generally lacked myofibroblasts. Only one cord specimen had microscopic features that were intermediate between nodule and cord. Electron microscopy demonstrated that in vivo differences between myofibroblasts from nodules and fibroblasts from cords and control skin samples could be preserved in vitro. Growth studies showed slower growth of cultured myofibroblasts (mean +/- SD generation time 68.7 +/- 15 h) than cord-derived fibroblasts (mean +/- SD generation time 51.5 +/- 0.9 h). These data suggest that the life cycle of the myofibroblasts from Dupuytren's disease nodules differs from that of fibroblasts found in cordlike tissues. These myofibroblasts have biological characteristics nearly identical to those of myofibroblasts found in other contracting tissues, such as granulating wounds and breast cancer.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,6491814,1984
The open palm technique for Dupuytren's contracture.,"The results of subtotal palmar fasciectomy employing an open palm technique have been reviewed. Full correction of the metacarpophalangeal flexion deformity was achieved in the majority of 120 hands which were followed up for between one and nine years after operation, but the results from associated digital dissection were less satisfactory. Leaving the transverse distal palmar wound open lessens many of the hazards inherent in a palmar dissection, and the approach is therefore relatively safe for the less experienced surgeon. Efficient supervision of the hand after surgery is of paramount importance and may influence the outcome as significantly as the operation itself.",International orthopaedics,6480188,1984
Palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's contracture). Ultrastructural and enzyme histochemical studies of 43 cases.,"Forty three cases of palmar fibromatosis were studied by light and electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, and ultrastructural immunohistochemistry. By electron microscopy most of the cells composing the nodules in both the proliferative and the involutional stages were identical to myofibroblasts. The myofibroblasts in the involutional nodules often possessed microfilament aggregates probably representing contraction of micro(actin)filaments in the cytoplasm. The proliferative nodules revealed small perivascular haemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits accompanied by accumulation of macrophages and some lymphocytes; these inflammatory cells possibly secrete a certain growth factor inducing proliferation of genetically abnormal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Diaminopeptidase IV was detected in myofibroblasts and fibroblasts by enzyme histochemistry and ultrastructural immunohistochemistry; the enzyme may play a role in the metabolism of intercellular substances. Some perivascular mesenchymal cells, interpreted as variants of myofibroblasts, had moderate activity of alkaline phosphatase.","Virchows Archiv.

Selective aponeurectomy by Skoog's method in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.,"Whatever surgical procedure is adopted in Dupuytren's contracture, it demands the utmost finesse and delicacy of technique. Even so, the functional and cosmetic results are often equivocal, but in our view Skoog's technique offers the most practical and effective method of treatment. It offers the following advantages: Duration of operation: In a case of moderate severity affecting only 2 digits the operation can be completed in 30-40 minutes. The surgical trauma is minimal and post-operative complications are therefore minimal. Recovery of function is rapid and there is complete absence of the disturbances associated with prolonged immobilisation. The relapse rate is minimal and certainly no greater than that associated with more radical techniques. The only disadvantage, if it can be so considered, is that the surgeon must be perfectly familiar with the detailed anatomy of the palm and fingers. Since the method does not involve the more extensive exposure and display of all the structures, as in other methods, it is easier in the absence of such knowledge to do accidental damage.",Italian journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,6676345,1983
Abnormal behavior of cultured fibroblasts from nodule and nonaffected aponeurosis of Dupuytren's disease.,"Vimentin-positive, desmin-negative cells were established in culture from the nodule and from apparently normal palmar aponeurosis of a patient with Dupuytren's disease and compared with normal human embryonic and adult fibroblasts or sarcomatous cells. Cells from the nodule display in vitro biological properties that are intermediate between those expressed by normal fibroblasts and sarcoma cells or cells from the nodule transformed with SV40 virus. Thus, they represent an interesting in vitro model of partially transformed human cells. This behavior is not evolutive and justifies the classification of Dupuytren's disease among the benign mesenchymal tumors. The production of high level of plasminogen activator probably explains the local reactive pathology, and could act as a mitogenic stimulus for the proliferation of the nodule itself. Cultures derived from the apparently normal palmar aponeurosis show some but not all the abnormal growth properties of cells from nodules; this may help to explain the onset of local recurrences. Our results suggest that Dupuytren's disease is not strictly local and limited to the nodules, but affects, at least partially, the whole aponeurosis. Dupuytren's nodules could be considered as a model of tumor progression in a benign situation.",Journal of cellular physiology,6197420,1983

"Dupuytren's contracture, chronic liver disease and IgA immune complexes.","Contrary to previous reports, Dupuytren's contracture was found to be equally common in patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic biopsy-proven liver disease (25% v 28%). Furthermore, in 69 patients with Dupuytren's contracture referred for surgical correction, there was no significant increase in either history of alcohol abuse or abnormality of liver function compared to a matched control group. Patients with Dupuytren's contracture were found to have increased levels of circulating IgA immune complexes compared to those without (p less than 0.05 for those with liver disease; p less than 0.001 for those awaiting surgical correction). Circulating immunoglobulins and immune complexes of other classes were similar between the groups with and without Dupuytren's contracture.

A population study of Dupuytren's contracture.,Nine hundred and nineteen patients attending orthopaedic clinics in the rural areas of the Cotswolds and Chilterns were examined for evidence of Dupuytren's contracture. Five per cent of men and 3.5 per cent of women showed evidence of the disease which was largely bilateral but confined to the palm in forty per cent of men and eighty per cent of women.

Lipid composition and de novo lipid biosynthesis of human palmar fat in Dupuytren's disease.,"Seventy-two surgically obtained Dupuytren's disease palmar-fat (DDPF) specimens and 18 location-matched specimens from patients not suffering from this disease (controls) were studied for their total lipid composition and de novo lipogenic activity. Incubation of &quot;DDPF&quot; with 1-[14C]acetate in oxygen produced [14C]palmitate and [14C]stearate in approximately equal yields as those obtained from &quot;controls.&quot; No [14C]octanate was formed in any of the palmar-fat preparations. The lipids and fatty acid analysis revealed differences: (a) DDPF specimens were richer in free fatty acids, methyl esters of fatty acids and free-cholesterol than specimens of controls. (b) DDPF specimens contained less phospholipids. (c) DDPF specimens showed a significantly higher content of octanoate and other short-chain fatty acids than specimens of controls. The above findings are not incompatible with the results expected if some mild hypoxia occurred in DDPF; this has been suggested in the statistical correlations observed for this disease and alcoholism with liver involvement.",Lipids,6877040,1983
The pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture: contractile mechanisms of the myofibroblasts.,"The role of myofibroblasts in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture was investigated by light and electron microscopic histochemical methods. Dupuytren's myofibroblasts contain an intracellular contractile mechanism that is driven by the dephosphorylation of adenosine triphosphate. Our study of calcium adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activities verifies that the site of this energy system is on the myofilaments of the myofibroblasts. The degree of ATPase activity, as determined by cell counts, appeared to correlate with the residual contracture as predicted by the Legge and McFarlane Outcome Standard Formula. Further, alcian blue staining on the ultrastructural level indicates that the myofibroblasts are associated with each other and with surrounding collagen by a glycosaminoglycan matrix 300 to 1000 A thick. Collagen fibrils are attached by a similar matrix comprised of 100 A thick fibrils. The dynamic cellular architecture of the multiple adjacent myofibroblasts with their connections to surrounding collagen may be partially responsible for the residual clinical deformities seen in this disease.",The Journal of hand surgery,6683733,1983

The relationship of hand abnormalities to diabetes and diabetic retinopathy.,"The hands of 299 diabetic patients with and 161 without retinopathy were examined for abnormalities. Almost all abnormalities were finger joint contractures resulting in limited joint mobility (LJM) and/or Dupuytren's contractures (DC). Both LJM and DC occurred not only in insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) but also in non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). In retinopathy patients LJM and DC occurred in 48% and 36% of patients, respectively, compared with 24% and 16% in those without retinopathy. These differences were statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The higher prevalence of LJM in the retinopathy group affected mainly those with severe retinopathy, there being no difference between background and nonretinopathy patients. DC was less clearly related to severe retinopathy. LJM was more severe in those with than without retinopathy. LJM and DC were also related to age and duration of known diabetes. Subgroups matched for age and duration of known diabetes showed that the main relationship of hand abnormalities was to retinopathy in IDDM, but more to age and duration of known diabetes in NIDDM.",Diabetes care,6343018,1983

Report of 72 cases.,"This report describes a new technique for treatment of the chronically flexed fingers which applies in particular to fingers previously operated on several times and now presenting cutaneous, tendinous and joint problems. It consists in releasing the entire flexor apparatus through a full length lateral digital incision and a sub periosteal dissection. The volar plates of PIP and DIP are released as a whole with the flexor apparatus. The extended finger and flexor apparatus then are allowed to heal in a new relationship. Straightening of the finger is always possible. The range of motion is maintained or increased. This technique can also be used in stiff PIP joints and in certain serious forms of Dupuytren's contracture. 56 cases are reviewed with 78% with good or fair results.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,9336654,1983
Epithelioid sarcoma.,"Epithelioid sarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor characterized by its propensity to occur in the distal extremities as a nodular lesion and its slow and asymptomatic growth. Microscopically, the diagnosis is difficult. Therefore the interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis averages one to three years. 10 years survival after onset are not uncommon whatever the treatment chosen. Having to treat such a tumor of a hand, 8 years after onset, we decided a local radical excision by micro-surgery instead of amputation or mutilating excision. Long standing clinical follow-up will add valuable information as to the cure of the upper extremity.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,9336649,1983
"Metabolism and proliferation of cultured fibroblasts from specimens of human palmar fascia and Dupuytren's contracture. The pathobiochemistry of connective tissue proliferation, II.","Cell Cultures from 11 Dupuytren's contracture and 6 normal palmar fascia specimens were established. The rates of sulphated glycosaminoglycan, collagen and DNA synthesis by means of incorporation of labelled precursors ([35S]sulphate, [3H]proline, [3]thymidine) as well as the growth characteristics of the cell lines of both healthy and diseased were compared. The incorporation rates of [35S]sulphate and [3H]proline were found to be significantly higher in Dupuytren than in healthy palmar fascia-deriving cell lines. In contrast, no differences in cell growth or DNA synthesis could be demonstrated. The abnormal capacity to synthesize sulphated glycosaminoglycans and collagen is attributed to a permanent modulation of cell characteristics which can be propagated into cell culture.",Journal of clinical chemistry and clinical biochemistry.

[Immunologic aspects in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture].,"In 30 patients suffering from Dupuytren' disease the following cellular and humoral tests were carried out: 1. Migration inhibitory test using the palmaraponeurosis as an antigen. - 2. Determination of the serum level of IgG, IgA and IgM. - 3. Determination of humoral antibodies against mitochondria, cellnuclei and smooth muscles. - An inhibition of migration could be observed in 24 out of 30 patients (80%) (MI 0.85). 6 patients had a migration index above 0.85. The serum-level of IgA was elevated in 12 patients. IgG was abnormal in only 5 patients out of 30; the same was true for IgM in 3 out of 30 patients. In 4 patients low titers of humoral antibodies could be found. Consequently, the conclusion is drawn that inadequate cellular immunoreaction against the same body tissue could be a prerequisite for the development of Dupuytren's disease.",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,6353806,1983

As a conclusion, the Author remembers the operative technique which gave the best results. Wide partial aponeurectomy.",Chirurgia italiana,6927030,1982
[Dupuytren's disease in clinical practice].,"The Authors have investigated the incidence of Dupuytren's disease in the field of internal medicine, they have observed a rather high rate in the old people, especially between 60 and 80 years, and point out the significance of metabolic and genetic factors in the pathogenesis and the development of the disease.",Minerva medica,7121881,1982
Wound complications in the surgical management of Dupuytren's contracture: a comparison of operative incisions.,"A prospective study was carried out comparing the z-plasty, volar zig-zag and open-palm incisions in eighty-two patients undergoing partial selective fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease. Flap necrosis, haematoma, and postoperative pain were greatest following the z-plasty and zig-zag incisions. While healing was somewhat delayed and a digital nerve was lacerated in the transverse open-palm group, the complication rate was lower overall and we now prefer this technique for partial selective fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease.",The Hand,7152373,1982
The microanatomy of Dupuytren's contracture.,"The palmar fascial ligaments have been examined by microdissection using an operating microscope in fresh and preserved cadaveric hands. The palmar fascia is seen to be a precise three dimensional system of skin ligaments having discreet transverse, longitudinal and vertical fibre systems. In the normal hand there is relative motion between the ligament systems on movement. The longitudinal fibres provide a system of skin anchorage which operates irrespective of the position of the underlying joints and acts particularly to resist shearing forces in gripping. The distribution of the lesions of Dupuytren's Disease has been recorded in a series of clinical cases; nodules, skin pits, distortion of the palmar creases, cords and joint contractures, and the pathogenesis of the disease is related to the anatomy of the palmar ligaments. The disease is described as a process of contracture along anatomical pathways. A hypothesis for the development of Dupuytren's Disease is presented whereby the loss of normal motion between palmar fascial ligaments gives rise on use of the hand to stress concentrations which stimulate fibrous tissue deposition and contracture.",The Hand,7152372,1982
Dupuytren's contracture: morphological and biochemical changes in palmar aponeurosis.,"The palmar aponeurosis removed from ten patients with Dupuytren's contracture was studied using morphological and biochemical approaches. The histological characteristic of Dupuytren's contracture is the presence of numerous nodules among the lamellar structures of the collagen fibres. In the nodules, there are many active fibroblasts which are surrounded by immature fibres and metachromatic substances demonstrated by toluidine blue staining. Ultrastructurally, the active fibroblasts have the characteristics of myofibroblasts, as previously reported by Dr. Gabbiani. We found that some fibroblasts have intracellular collagen fibrils in the cytoplasm. When assayed by Siegel and Martin's method, lysyl oxidase activity of the palmar aponeurosis was significantly higher in Dupuytren's contracture than in normal hands. Biochemical studies such as electrophoretic analysis of mucopolysaccharides, determination of uronic acid and collagen contents were undertaken to compare the aponeurosis of Dupuytren's contracture with normal cases. The uronic acid contents were higher in Dupuytren's contracture than in the controls. However, no difference between the two groups was found in the collagen contents and in the composition of the mucopolysaccharides. These characteristic features; existence of myofibroblasts and intracellular collagen fibrils and increase in the activity of lysyl oxidase probably play a significant role in the establishment of flexion contracture of the fingers in Dupuytren's contracture.",The Hand,6130030,1982
Location of Dupuytren's disease on the radial aspect of the hand.,"The fibrous elements of the radial side of the hand, i.e., index, first web space, and thumb, have not previously been fully described. However, involvement of this area may be significant, as seen in patients with a malignant form of Dupuytren's disease known as Dupuytren's diathesis, and adequate surgical removal depends on knowledge of the anatomy. Using cadavers, four major fibrous elements are defined: (1) the fibrous skeleton of the thenar eminence; (2) the radial longitudinally-oriented fibers of the palmar aponeurosis; (3) the distal transverse commissural ligament of the first web; and (4) the proximal transverse commissural ligament. These fibrous elements correspond with the four major locales of contracture seen in patients with radial sided involvement and can produce a variety of contractures: metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal flexion, abduction/opposition and/or adduction of the thumb. Surgical management, designed to correct deformity and prevent extension and recurrences, can be achieved by extensive excision of involved tissue and skin grafts. This can be accomplished by zig-zag incisions over isolated contractures of the fibrous elements or in combination with Z-plasty if the involvement is more extensive. Besides extensive aponeurectomy, tendon sheath releases and capsulotomies may be necessary. Use of skin grafts helps prevent recurrences. Full or thick split-thickness grafts should be used with discretion avoiding major sensory areas or open tendon sheaths.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,7049485,1982
Dorsal Dupuytren's disease.,"A previously undescribed lesion of Dupuytren's disease is presented. Between the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint and that of the distal interphalangeal joint, the extensor tendon expansion was found to be involved in an actively contracting nodule of Dupuytren's disease. Resection of this nodule restored full extensor tendon excursion. The lesion was quite distinct from the classic &quot;knuckle pad' lesion seen in similar patients with a strong diathesis.",The Journal of hand surgery,7119399,1982
Identification of an inherited form of Peyronie's disease with autosomal dominant inheritance and association with Dupuytren's contracture and histocompatibility B7 cross-reacting antigens.,"Peyronie's disease is an inflammatory disorder with no confirmed etiology. We have documented the familial transmission of the disease as an autosomal dominant trait in 3 pedigrees. The occurrence of Dupuytren's contracture in 7 of 9 (78 per cent) affected individuals, which is a significant increase over the average 0 per cent reported in sporadic cases, suggests that both of these fibrosing disorders are pleiotropic effects of the same gene in these families. Similarly, the histocompatibility B7 cross-reacting antigens were present in 90 per cent of the patients with Peyronie's disease. Additional studies, including careful family histories and histocompatibility antigen typing, are necessary to elucidate the role of histocompatibility antigens as a relative risk factor.",The Journal of urology,6980996,1982
Peyronie's disease: a newly recognized autosomal-dominant trait.,"Peyronie's disease, a connective tissue disorder of unknown cause, is characterized by the formation of thickened fibrous plaques on the dorsum of the penis. It often occurs simultaneously with other fibrotic changes, most notably Dupuytren's contracture of the hands or feet. There are no previous reports suggesting inheritance of this syndrome; however, Willscher et al reported an association between Peyronie's disease and antigens of the HLA-B7 cross-reacting group. Family studies were undertaken when three patients reported similarly affected first-degree relatives. One kindred showed father-to-son transmission of Peyronie's disease with Dupuytren's contracture in three generations. Pedigree analysis of the three families suggests that Peyronie's syndrome is a male-limited, autosomal-dominant trait. Antigens of the HLA-B7 cross-reacting group occurred in all three kindreds; however, the data ruled out close linkage of the disease and HLA.",American journal of medical genetics,6213155,1982
[Fibromatosis plantaris Ledderhose (Dupuytren's contracture of the foot sole].,"Fibromatosis plantaris, also called Ledderhose disease, is presented on the basis of the limited literature available. The possible causes are mentioned. Two cases are reported of patients suffering from fibromatosis palmaris (Dupuytren) on both hands and fibromatosis plantaris (Ledderhose) on both feet simultaneously. It is suggested that more attention be paid to examination of the soles of the feet, especially after a period of immobilization and plaster fixation of the shank. On diagnosis of Ledderhose disease, surgery should be performed before the often irreversible deformation of the toes develops.",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,7079701,1982
Ultrastructural relationship of skin to nodule and cord in Dupuytren's contracture.,"The interface of skin and nodule or cord was studied in Dupuytren's contracture in 11 patients using light and electron microscopy. Four distinct anatomic zones were seen in he skin/nodule specimens, with three zones in skin/cord. Skin/nodule specimens had a striking horizontally layered dense band just underneath the dermis, a feature not found in skin/cord specimens. Electron microscopy showed active contractile fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) in the lower two zones in skin/nodule, with clusters of active and degenerating cells side by side. No myofibroblasts were seen in either the skin/cord or any skin specimen. These data suggest that the nodule is the active source of contraction in Dupuytren's contracture. Skin overlying both nodule and cord appears to be drawn passively by underlying contraction forces. A local defect in palmar skin may prevent normal inhibition of myofibroblast contraction. More aggressive resection of fascia and dermis may be indicated in skin/nodule areas.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,7071229,1982
Dupuytren's contracture in manual workers.,"The incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing plant, where a great deal of bagging and packing took place by hand, was higher than in another plant in which there was no bagging or packing. The incidence in the packing plant was double that found in an earlier survey by Early at Crewe Locomotive Works of 4801 individuals, most of whom were manual workers. The implication is that the nature of the work of bagging and packing in our PVC compounding plant may have triggered Dupuytren's contracture.",British journal of industrial medicine,7066227,1982
[Dupuytren's contracture and diabetes mellitus].,"The literature suggests that the frequency of Dupuytren's disease is ten times greater in diabetes than in the general population. We have studied 42 diabetic patients with a contracture of the palmar fascia. Dupuytren's contracture can be considered a complication of diabetes and of the local neurovascular changes since both are often associated. The contracture is usually not severe in diabetes, is nodular in form, and usually crushes the palmar surface of the long and ring fingers. It is usually well tolerated by the patients and surgery is rarely indicated, particularly in view of the advanced age of many patients. In caring for patients with Dupuytren's disease, surgeons should also rule out the presence of diabetes with appropriate test.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,9382632,1982
Lateral digital rotation flaps in the treatment of forms of Dupuytren's contracture. 141 cases.,"Severe contractures of the little finger can be corrected with a rotation flap. It has been used 141 times in a homogeneous series of 522 Dupuytren diseases. This flap brought to the metacarpophalangeal crease to the proximal phalanx can provide a skin lengthening of about 15 mm. The incision can be extended to the palm in order to remove the other fascial lesions. It was used mainly on the little finger (9 times out of 10). A single flap was usually made, but one may use two flaps from contiguous fingers, and even raise two flaps from the same finger. A comparative study with &quot;Z&quot; plasties was carried out. Out of 131 &quot;Z&quot; plasties with an average lack of extension of 126 degrees, the rate of improvement was 57%. The rotation flap was used in 141 cases with an average lack of extension of 140 degrees, and the rate of improvement was 79%. This flap seems to be an interesting procedure in the surgical treatment of severe Dupuytren contractures and seems more efficient than &quot;Z&quot; plasties.",Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,9336611,1982
Treatment of old introclable lesions of the extensors of the middle finger by resection arthroplasty with implant.,Traumatic boutonniere deformity may become fixed and cannot be reduced when the joint cartilage become altered. We propose a resection arthroplasty with a Swanson's silicone implant as a valuable solution for this problem as it simplifies the joint and the extensor apparatus. We use a transverse approach through the extensor tendon which enables to restore a good balance between bone and tendon and seems to avoid some adhesions. Results of 17 operations with a minimum follow up of 12 months show that 40 degrees of motion have been recovered in an angle sector which corrects the deformity. The final evaluation is good if compared to the severity of the initial status.,Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main,9303038,1982

[Dupuytren contracture in Mosel wine dressers with arsenic-induced aftereffect damage].,"Between 1972 and 1981 a total of 121 male and female wine-dressers with late after-effects from arsenic were medically examined and treated. Skin and liver were examined regularly every 3 months. With advancing years an increase in typically arsenic melanosis, precancerous, carcinomas and hyperkeratosis in palmae and plantae was observed. A significant increase in Dupuytren's contracture was found in the age groups between 50 and 80 with a growing progression of typically arsenic horned pearls on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The typically arsenic horned pearls and arsenical keratosis occurred most frequently in the Dupuytrenical changes of the skin. The liver parameters showed no pathological results such as cirrhosis of the liver as compared with the other patients.",Dermatosen in Beruf und Umwelt. Occupation and environment,6218979,1982
Glycosaminoglycan synthesis by Dupuytren's cells in culture.,Glycosaminoglycan synthesis by cells cultured from nodule or band tissues of patients with Dupuytren's disease was compared with that of skin fibroblasts cultured from uninvolved areas of the palm. No differences were observed in culture which could account either for the abnormal glycosaminoglycan content or the increased cellularity of the diseased tissues. It is suggested that the behavior of Dupuytren's cells in vivo may result from a response to local conditions within the palm rather than from the expression of an irreversible change in their glycosaminoglycan metabolism.,Connective tissue research,6215210,1982
The glycosaminoglycans of Dupuytren's disease.,"The total and individual glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content at various stages of the Dupuytren disease process and in samples of normal palmar connective tissue (palmar dermis, palmar fascia and digital flexor tendon) from the hands of uninvolved age-matched controls have been assayed and compared. Morphological comparisons between the different tissues were made by histological examination of sections stained to demonstrate collagen fiber patterns and glycosaminoglycan distribution. Significant differences in the type and amount of GAG were found between the various manifestations of the disease process, i.e., nodules, cellular and fibrous bands, and between these and the normal palmar connective tissues. In the most actively proliferating cellular regions chondroitin sulfate levels were 11 times greater than those of the normal palmar connective tissues, whereas dermatan sulfate tissue levels showed a fourfold increase. On the other hand, tissue concentrations of hyaluronate were similar to those of normal palmar connective tissue. The relationship of these differences in GAG levels to the development and maturation of the normal palmar connective tissues and the Dupuytren's process is discussed.",Connective tissue research,6213370,1982
Dupuytren's disease and the sickle-cell trait in a female black patient.,Dupuytren's contracture is not often seen in the black-skinned patient. The combination of a Dupuytren's contracture in a black female patient who also carried the sickle-cell trait is described. This association of two diseases in a dark skinned patient has important surgical and anaesthetic implications which must not be forgotten in those countries with a large number of immigrants from the &quot;sickle-cell&quot; areas of the world.,British journal of plastic surgery,7296148,1981
A study of Dupuytren's tissue with the scanning electron microscope.,"This study was designed to determine if structural changes in the palmar fascia in Dupuytren's disease, as viewed by the scanning electron microscope, might provide some information about the pathogenesis of this disease. The palmar fascia from seven uninvolved hands and from 21 patients with Dupuytren's disease was examined. There were distinct differences between normal and diseased collagen. The diseased tissue showed collagen that was more tightly bound and had a shorter wave pattern. In the Dupuytren's tissue the waves were frequently in a helix, but this was never seen in the normal tissue. The most striking differences were noted in the nodule, presumably because it appears first, followed by the cord proximal to the nodule (pretendinous cord). Similar but less obvious changes were noted in the cord distal to the nodule (central cord) presumably because it is last to form. These observations suggest a mechanism of contraction. The short wave length and helix formation of the collagen indicate shortening. If the concept of the myofibroblast as a contractile cell is accepted, the contraction of these cells in stepwise fashion could produce the changes in the structure of the collagen that have been observed and result in joint contracture.",The Journal of hand surgery,7276480,1981
Dupuytren's contracture: the deferred Z-plasty.,"The technique of dissecting Dupuytren's contracture through a straight incision placed along the contracting band and deferring Z-plasty to be performed as a secondary procedure is safe, simple, and short and allows maximum skin viability and earliest mobilisation.",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,7271195,1981
"A comparative study of the activity of lysosomal and main metabolic pathway enzymes in tissue biopsies and cultured fibroblasts from Dupuytren's disease and palmar fascia. On the pathobiochemistry of connective tissue proliferation, I.","Activities of ten main metabolic pathway enzymes and seven lysosomal enzymes were determined in specimens from human normal palmar fascia and Dupuytren's contracture. The activities of the enzymes tested are 2-3 times higher in fresh specimens of Dupuytren's contracture. There are no differences in the activity distribution patterns of both these specimens, or in the absolute activities calculated in relation of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. With the exception of adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase, the activities of main metabolic pathway enzymes based on the DNA content showed significantly lower activities in Dupuytren's contracture tissue than in palmar fascia. Lysosomal enzymes exhibit no significant differences of activity in the respective specimens. However, the lysosomal enzyme activities of cultured fibroblasts are lower than the corresponding activities from tissue specimens. The enzyme activities per DNA content in cultured fibroblasts are 10-50 times higher than in tissue specimens. The enzyme activities in cultured fibroblasts decrease with age or density of the cells in culture. The increased metabolic activity of the diseased tissues in Dupuytren's contracture is due to the higher cell content of the afflicted portions of the tissue, but individual enzymes show no qualitative changes in activity and there are no increases of enzyme activity per cell (DNA).",Journal of clinical chemistry and clinical biochemistry.

Biochemical changes in the collagen of the palmar fascia in patients with Dupuytren's disease.,"The palmar fascial tissues of more than 400 patients with Dupuytren's disease were studied biochemically and compared with normal tissue obtained from more than 100 patients who were undergoing hand surgery for other reasons. No alterations of the molecular structure or the state of macromolecular aggregation of the collagen in Dupuytren's disease were detected by wide or low-angle x-ray diffraction studies or by transmission electron microscopy. Major biochemical changes in the palmar fascia affected by Dupuytren's disease included increased collagen and hexosamine contents and the presence of galactosamine in the most severely involved tissue. Type-III collagen, which is virtually absent from normal adult palmar fascia, was abundant in the tissue of patients with Dupuytren's disease. Post-translational modifications included a very elevated hydroxylysine content, an increase in the total number of reducible cross-links, and the appearance of hydroxylysinohydroxynorleucine (virtually absent from normal palmar fascia) as the major reducible cross-link. Even palmar fascia from patients with Dupuytren's disease that appeared grossly and histologically normal showed the same biochemical changes, albeit to a lesser extent. All of these biochemical changes are similar to those that occur during the active stages of connective-tissue wound repair. This includes the rapid synthesis and turnover of collagen which leads to newly synthesized, immature collagen being more abundant in the involved tissue than in normal tissue. There is no evidence that the gross, macroscopic contracture of the palmar fascia in Dupuytren's disease is due to shortening, plication, or contraction of the collagen fibrils or fibers present in the tissue at the onset of the disease or synthesized during its development. Instead, we propose that the gross contracture (shortening) of the palmar fascia in Dupuytren's disease is due to an active cellular process that progressively draws the distal extremities of the affected tissue closer together at the same time that the original tissue is being replaced. The result of these two processes is simply a shorter, smaller piece of tissue fabric containing collagen molecules, fibrils, and fibers of normal length and organization, but with pretranslational and posttranslational modifications similar to those observed in collagens during the active stages of connective-tissue repair in general.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

[Clinical picture in Sudeck's dystrophy].,"Concerning course, symptomatology and morphology the clinical picture of Sudeck's dystrophy is commented unanimously. Different views of pathogenesis, terminology, and therapy are still existing. Among multifarious contributing factors, vasomotor reflexes as well as endogenous factors are of particular significance. Methods of treatment and their benefits within different stages are pointed out and discussed. Besides physical treatment, application of calcitonin or neurostimulation are viewed to be effective. In cases of progressing dystrophy blocking of the sympathetic ganglia or (periarterial) sympathectomy are still measures of benefit. Prophylaxis is of great importance, though Sudeck's dystrophy is not always avoidable.",Fortschritte der Medizin,6165661,1981
Dupuytren's contracture.,"There is a strong genetic predisposition to this disease, and it is clearly associated with other conditions such as alcoholism and epilepsy. The pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown. Primary manifestations are nodule formation and contraction of palmar fascia. Secondary manifestations include plantar fibromatosis and Peyronie's disease. Close periodic examination is required in the early stages. Surgical intervention is indicated to alleviate contractions, and postoperative physical therapy is essential.",American family physician,7234634,1981

Prediction of results of treatment of Dupuytren's disease.,"Although Dupuytren's disease is common it is still not fully understood. A series of patients has been assessed by multiple regression analysis from which &quot;outcome standards&quot; have been formulated. It is anticipated that this method of analysis will further our understanding of the disease when greater numbers of patients are added to the study. As well, the application of an &quot;outcome standard&quot; to a given patient should reduce the number of unexpectedly poor results obtained and expose errors in the primary management of those patients.",The Journal of hand surgery,7430610,1980
Treatment considerations in carpal tunnel syndrome with coexistent Dupuytren's disease.,"Twenty-nine patients with involvement of 31 hands presented with coexisting carpal tunnel syndrome and ipsilateral Dupuytren's disease. Analysis of the patient population showed a high proportion of women, dominant hand involvement, and repetitive manual trauma. Various treatment combinations were used and the results evaluated. Simultaneous surgical excision of Dupuytren's contracture and carpal tunnel release gave compromised long-term results, particularly among the women. To minimize complications, it is advised that carpal tunnel release not be performed at the same time as excision of Dupuytren's contracture.",The Journal of hand surgery,7430596,1980
Dupuytren's contracture: clinical and therapeutic aspects.,"The writers first describe the main features of the pathological anatomy and clinical characteristics of Dupuytren's contracture. They classify the lesions by Tubiana's method, which is eminently objective and practical. This classification divides the lesions, according to their severity, in five stages: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The surgical technique of total aponeurectomy used by the authors is described. The total case material is thirty patients, with thirty-three hands operated on. By comparing the state of the hand before and after operation, the degree of improvement was calculated as a percentage derived from Tubiana's method of classification. A careful evaluation of the results confirms the validity of the therapeutic approach adopted. The indications and prognosis depend on the severity of the initial lesions. In general the chances of cure are good up to stage 3; but once this stage has been passed, and especially if hyperextension of the terminal phalanx is present, there is a high probability of recurrence and failure. In these cases they advise against corrective surgery and consider arthrodesis or amputation a more suitable alternative.",Italian journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,7216725,1980
The role of the myofibroblast in Dupuytren's contracture.,"A case report of Dupuytren's contracture illustrates the functional and light and electron microscopic characteristics of the myofibroblast. The myofibroblast is now associated with an increasing number of diseases, and is believed to be a morphologic and functional variant of the fibroblast, which shows changes typical of smooth-muscle cells. Its presence may be suspected by light microscopy, but its ultrastructure is characteristic. Its distinctive electron microscopic features are a fibrillar system in the cytoplasm similar to that of a smooth muscle, nuclear deformations indicative of contraction, and surface membrane differentiations that provide attachment to neighboring cells and stroma.",Archives of dermatology,7396546,1980

"Dupuytren's contracture. An electron microscopic, biochemical, and clinical correlative study.","Fascial specimens were obtained from twenty-four patients treated operatively for Dupuytren's contracture. The nodules and cords were examined by electron microscopic and biochemical techniques. The clinical course and response to operative treatment were then correlated with the tissue findings. Electron microscopic analysis revealed myofibroblasts in the nodules of seven of twenty-four patients. Fibroblasts containing prominent microtubules were found in ten patients. The fascia contained type-III collagen, increased amounts of collagen per unit of dry weight, and an increase in reducible cross-links of collagen. While the nodules were noted to contain a greater increase in reducible cross-links than the cords, there was little variation in the biochemical findings from patient to patient. Clinical recurrence was not related to the age of the patient at onset, duration, or severity of disease. Recurrence was related to the electron microscopic findings of myofibroblasts in the nodules and fibroblasts containing prominent microtubules in the fascia of these patients.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Vascular spiders, palmar erythema and Dupuytren's contracture appeared related to the hepatic involvement from alcoholism rather than to the alcoholism by oneself. In the alcoholic cirrhosis the Dupuytren's contracture affected patients younger than those of the others groups and had been influenced from the association of diabetes mellitus, but not from the occupational activity.",Archivio per le scienze mediche,7224858,1980
Biochemistry and histology of the connective tissue of Dupuytren's disease lesions.,"When compared to age-matched control aponeurosis, lesions of Dupuytren's disease contain higher contents of water, collagen and chondroitin-sulphate, as well as increased proportions of soluble collagens and of reducible cross-links; these indicate synthesis of new collagen. The lesions show also increased amounts of type III collagen and an increased hydroxylation and glycosylation of the reducible cross-links. All these parameters are characteristic of granulation and scar tissues. Type III collagen was located by means of immunofluorescence on thin argyrophilic fibres and also within the large fibre bundles which appeared to be disrupted into microbundles. The increase of type III collagen and the presence of myofibroblasts in the apparently unaffected aponeurosis show that the disease is widespread and suggest that it is initiated within the aponeurosis and propagated by the cells migrating along the collagen bundles.",European journal of clinical investigation,6768572,1980
[The treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. A social medical problem (author's transl)].,"After a brief description of the characteristics of Dupuytren's disease the operative and conservative therapeutic measures are examined from both clinical and social medical aspects. It is shown in 154 patients with Dupuytren's contracture of the hands in various stages that an advance of this disease could usually be prevented by treatment with soft X-rays. A comparison of costs shows that this therapy is at least 11 times cheaper than a good operative procedure without follow-up treatment. For the patient it is highly important that only little time is lost in the outpatient compared with inpatient treatment. Loss of work-place, professional incapacity or inability to work because of Dupuytren's disease can be prevented with a probability bordering on certainty.","MMW, Munchener medizinische Wochenschrift",6767935,1980
[Micromorphological studies in Dupuytren's disease].,"Based on histological and scan electron microscopic investigations the morphology of Dupuytren's disease was studied. For comparison normal samples from the palm of the hand were used. Because scan electron microscopy permits a three dimensional observation of surfaces, cut as well as break preparations of cases in stages II, III and IV as well as from relapse cases were furnished and examined. The findings were as follows: 1) The border between cutis and underlying tissue was not distinct any more. 2) The subcutaneous fat tissue has been thrust aside and replaced by newly formed collagen. 3) Starting from the aponeurosis thickened net-like collagen fibers stretch across into the cutis causing skin retractions 4) Within the aponeurosis palmaris collagen bundles exhibit considerable deviation in diameter and structure. 5) A classification of different stages of the disease according to morphological findings proves to be impossible.",Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete,7415423,1980
[The treatment of Dupuytren's contracture from the medical gymnastic standpoint].,"A special treatment program has been developed for each individual patient. Each day the patient receives three different treatment modalities--active exercises, passive exercises and electrical stimulation. On days when X-ray therapy is administered, the patient performs only active exercises and receives no electrical stimulation. The patient is also directed to perform certain exercises at home. Patients are advised strongly against the use of hot baths. Dynamic splints are adjusted regularly. In winter and during cold weather, patients are instructed to wear gloves. This therapy, combined with meticulous surgical technique, permits the rehabilitation of most hands affected by Dupuytren's contracture. The goal of rehabilitation is tailored to the needs of the patient and should include a sufficiently strong grasp, chuck pinch and possibly a good pulp pinch. When necessary, the therapy should be continued for long periods of time because a small gain in mobility may represent a significant improvement in overall function of the hand.",Handchirurgie,7250792,1980
[The role of myofibroblasts in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture].,"The involved palmar aponeurosis of 30 patients in different stages of Dupuytren's disease was removed and examined by light and electron microscopy. The specimens were obtained by Z-plasty and limited fasciectomy. The light microscopic slides of the early stages of the disease showed areas rich in cells and surrounded by a network of collagen fibres. In the late phase of the lesion mature scar tissue was observed. By electron microscopy fibroblast-like cells--so-called myofibroblasts were seen in the early stages of the lesion. These cells possess, in addition to nuclear deformations, the following ultrastructural cytoplasmic characteristics: microfibrils occasionally forming small dense bodies, prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, many mitochondria and free ribosomes. The cell surface if partly covered by a &quot;basement membrane&quot;. The myofibroblasts attach to each other frequently through hemidesmosomes or desmosomes. According to data in the literature, the microfilaments within the cytoplasm contain actin, consequently these cells have the property of contraction. In our opinion--in accordance with some other authors--the myofibroblasts might play an important role in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture.",Handchirurgie,7195866,1980
Possible role of myofibroblasts in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture.,"In the contracting palmar aponeurosis of patients suffering from Dupuytren's disease myofibroblasts are revealed by electron microscopical examination. These cells display abnormal foldings of the nucleus, microfilaments resembling the myofilaments in smooth muscle cells, rough endoplasmic reticulum occupying circumscribed portions of the cytoplasm, free ribosomes, well-developed Golgi apparatus, numerous mitochondria, occasionally lipid droplets, cilia-like formations, hemidesmosomes and maculae adherens (desmosomes) between the cells and formation of basement membrane. According to literary data, the myofibroblasts contain actin and have contractile properties. These myofibroblasts are supposed to contribute to the development of Dupuytren's contracture. The process is finally stabilized by the disappearance of myofibroblasts and by the simultaneous development of compact collagenous fibre bundles secernated by classical fibroblasts.",Acta morphologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae,7192480,1980
The ultrastructural characteristics of abnormal collagen fibrils in various organs.,"Quite unrelated diseases affecting different organs can lead to the appearance of abnormal collagen fibrils, which may be due to genetic disorders, transformation of mesenchyme cells, increased collagen synthesis or a change in the ground-substance. The simultaneous appearance of abnormal collagen fibrils and matrix vesicles containing lysosomal enzymes in the majority of our electron photomicrographs suggests an alteration in the ground-substance as a main cause of non-hereditary collagen dysplasia.",Connective tissue research,6450022,1980
The effect of intermittent pneumatic compression on the hand after fasciectomy.,"Thirty-nine patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture were included in a fully randomised, matched, prospective trial to evaluate the effect of intermittent compression on the post-operative hand. The study revealed a definite improvement in the treated, over the control patients. There was a distinct decrease in oedema with almost immediate return to normal hand function in the group treated by compression. Other benefits accrued from the earlier subsidence of pain in treated hands requiring reduced or no analgesia and from the earlier expression of fluid discharge from the wound thus preventing haematoma formation and the consequent ills.",The Hand,520877,1979
[The blood-flow in hands with Dupuytren's contracture and Raynaud disease: functional and morphological studies (author's transl)].,"Concerning the question whether a correlation between the vasospasm and morphological changes in the neuro-myo-arterial glomerular (Hoyer-Grosser-Organ) exists also in Dupuytren disease, a series of 18 patients with Dupuytren and 5 patients with Raynaud disease were studied by finger venous occlusion plethysmography and finger tip biopsies. No typical histological changes were found in Dupuytren's Contracture, particularly none in the 13 cases (70%) which had a latent vasospasm and none in the 5 cases (30%) which had a normal plethysmogram, whereas in all the patients with Raynaud disease the typical morphological changes of wall, lumen and morphometric counts of the &quot;Suquet-Hoyer&quot; canals were found in correspondance to the abnormal plethysmogram.

[Substantiation of the surgical approaches in Dupuytren's contracture and the technic of the operations].,The work substantiates the operative access in aponeurectomy for the Dupuytren's contracture realized by a wave-shaped incision in the zone of pathologically changed aponeurosis depending on the individual disposition of nodulous indurations and on a certain height of skin grafts in relation to the base. The operation technique is also described with special reference to possible errors resulting in serious sequelae. The complications observed are also described. Their number is less than that in the data of other papers which shows the positive result of the work as a whole.,Vestnik khirurgii imeni I. I. Grekova,505808,1979
Collagen types and anticollagen-antibodies in Dupuytren's disease.,The relative proportion of collagen type I and type III in the aponeurosis of twenty-four patients with Dupuytren's disease was determined and compared with the aponeurosis of normal persons. The presence of considerable amounts of type III collagen was found in the Dupuytren's disease patients. The sera of the patients were screened for circulating anti-collagen antibodies using a sensitive radioimmunoassay. In seven out of the twenty-four patients low concentrations of these antibodies were found.,The Hand,391658,1979
Palmar fibromatosis-&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;. A comparison of light electron and immunofluorescence microscopic findings.,"A comparison of light, immunofluorescence and electron microscopic findings in palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's disease) revealed that the three morphologic phase of Luck; I. proliferative, 2. involutional, and 3. residual, corresponded for the most part to I. fibroblastic, 2. myofibroblastic or 3. fibrocytic lesions, respectively. The spectrum between proliferative phase and residual phase appeared immunohistochemically as a decrease in collagen type III, and an increase of collagen type I. Myosin was found in substantial quantities only during the involutional phase, distinguished by myofibroblasts, presumably with contractile capabilities. Thus, the clinical presence of contractures with palmar fibromatosis might also be explained in the absence of distinct fiber formation.","Pathology, research and practice",390518,1979
[Ultrastructural investigations of the palmarfascia in M. Dupuytren (author's transl)].,"The palmarfascia of 30 patients with Dupuytrens disease was investigated light- and electron microscopically. As typical changes there exist an increase in cells which form noduli. Many cells contain contractile filaments in their cytoplasma are therefore described as myofibroblasts. Beside these cells active fibroblasts could be observed. Close to their cell membranes there occur filaments with a diameter of 100--300 A. In a greater distance fibrils and fibers with a diameter of 400--600 A were observed. The regular order of the connective tissue is disturbed, one often can observe &quot;vortex&quot; like structures. The lumina of many capillaries are collapsed. The pericytes are increased. The nerve fibers are morphologically unchanged - they are often closely surrounded by collagen fibers. Respecting the morphological findings the pathogenesis of Dupuytrens disease is discussed.",Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete,463223,1979
Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture by extensive fasciectomy through multiple Y-V--plasty incisions: short-term evaluation of 170 consecutive operations.,"The zigzag incision with Y-V closure has unique advantages for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. Much skin can be mobilized to the longitudinal finger axis. There is rarely a need for skin grafting in spite of full correction of the deformity. This approach, combined with properly applied tamponade bulk dressing, allows for early use of the hand with minimal morbidity.",The Journal of hand surgery,86553,1979

In agreement with the literature it was found that 90% of the patients are men. 29.9% are in the 5th decade of life at the time of the operation. The disease usually begins on one side. But after up to 3 years the second hand is also affected in 51%. The preferred location, both in its entirety and also in relation to the initial manifestation, is the ulnar portion of the hand. Because of the progressive nature of the complaint, relapses are to be expected even after a successful operation. At the time of the follow-up, 26.2% of the patients had recurrences. A correlation between the clinical picture and the histological phase classifications is not possible with certainty.","MMW, Munchener medizinische Wochenschrift",102982,1978
[Collagen metabolism in Dupuytren's contracture].,"Impairments in collagen metabolism were observed in patients with Dupuytren's contracture. These impairments were manifested as an increased excretion of hydroxyproline with urine and a decrease in content of the amino acid in tissues of aponeurosis palmaris of the patients. The alterations correlated with the damage caused by contracture. Increased catabolism of collagen appears to be the main reason of the metabolic impairments observed in Dupuytren's contracture, considering the opposite direction of changes in hydroxyproline content in urine and in aponeurosis palmaris of the patients. Impairments in collagen metabolism were of considerable importance in Dupuytren's contracture as demonstrated by the correlation between biochemical alterations and severity of the pathology. The Dupuytren's contracture might be considered as a disease affecting the connective tissue.",Voprosy meditsinskoi khimii,734986,1978

Wound contraction and fibrocontractive disorders.,"A most important contribution to the understanding of wound healing has been the identification of the myofibroblast. These cells contract like smooth muscle cells and have been identified in a variety of chronic and open wounds. The myofibroblasts have been reported as the causative factor resulting in the wound contraction. This report demonstrates the presence of the myofibroblasts in breast capsule contraction, as well as in Peyronie's disease. The presence of the myofibroblast in Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren's contracture suggests that the myofibroblast may be the causal factor behind the association of these two disorders. The evidence suggests that a spectrum of fibrocontractive disorders exists that has the myofibroblast as the common denominator. Some evidence is presented that permits the speculation that the myofibroblast may be a transformation of the local fibroblast to a smooth muscle cell in response to forces applied to the tissue.","Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",687101,1978

Dupuytren's disease--the influence of occupation and previous hand injuries.,"The influence of handedness, work and previous hand trauma is studied in 901 persons with Dupuytren's disease, collected in an epidemiological study of 15,950 citizens in a small, Norwegian town. Dupuytren's disease occurred in all occupational groups, but the prevalence was higher and the contracture more severe in people doing hard manual work than in people doing light or non manual work. Persons with Dupuytren's disease has sustained previous hand trauma more frequently than the general population, and the interval between trauma and first sign of disease was usually a few years. Previous hand injuries were definitely more common among people doing hard manual work, but even when these were excluded from the work material, Dupuytren's disease was still more common among people doing hard manual work, than in people doing light or non manual work. The study has indicated that Dupuytren's disease in certain cases is precipitated and/or aggravated by both work and definite hand injury.",The Hand,710978,1978

Pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture: a correlative clinical-pathological study.,"The tissue from 38 patients with Dupuytren's contracture was submitted for light and electron microscopy. The clinical and pathological data were correlated so that three stages of disease were recognized: early, active, and advanced. The cell of early disease was the perivascular fibroblast; whereas, the cell of active disease was the myofibroblast. Because the myofibroblasts have cell-to-cell and cell-to-stroma attachments, the collagen not only becomes oriented as it is formed, but it also is subjected to a contractile force.",The Journal of hand surgery,621363,1978

Collagen of Dupuytren's disease.,"1. In contrast to collagen from the aponeurosis of normal adult subjects, the nodules, contractures and apparently unaffected aponeurosis from patients with Dupuytren's disease contained substantial amounts of type III collagen. 2. The presence of type III collagen supports the previous proposal that the initial response to injury is the synthesis of an increased proportion of this form of collagen. The increased amounts in the apparently unaffected aponeurosis indicate the disease is not strictly focal but more systemic than is usually considered.",Clinical science and molecular medicine,589933,1977
[Alcohol-induced hyperlipoproteinemia].,"Tests on 100 alcoholic patients revealed increased lipoprotein levels in 24%. Type IV was the most frequently ecountered (80%), followed by type II or V. The average plasma triglyceride level of the alcoholic group was significantly increased in comparison with a control population. The causal mechanism of alcoholic hyperlipoproteinemia remains poorly understood. The combination of a genetic defect of lipid metabolism, nutritional factors and acute alcohol excess may have an essential bearing on the incidence of hyperlipoproteinemia. Acute excessive intake of alcohol was significantly increased in comparison with alcoholic subjects wihtout hyperlipoproteinemia. The critical dose may be a daily ethanol consumption of about 200 gm. There appeared to be no correlation between acute pancreatic injury or active liver disease and serum lipid elevation. On the other hand, the observation was confirmed that alcoholic patients with hepatic cirrhosis usually do not develop hyperlipoproteinemia. Ethanol-induced hyperlipoproteinemia may be a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and pancreatitis.",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,918592,1977

Occurrence of myofibroblasts in the different phases of morbus Dupuytren (Dupuytren's contracture).,"Twenty-one surgically removed specimens of Morbus Dupuytren (M. D.) were studied by light and electron microscopy. The cell type observed in the proliferative phase shows the basic ultrastructural features of fibroblasts, while the majority of the cells in the involutional phase resemble myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts exhibit ultrastructural characteristics of both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and are said to behave functionally like smooth muscle cells. In the residual phase, typical fibrocytes of connective tissue are found. These findings confirm the concept that fibroblasts are capable of converting into myofibroblasts and demonstrate the myofibroblasts represent an intermediate cell type of transitional cellular differentiation. The significance of myofibroblasts for the development of the contracture of M. D. is discussed.",Beitrage zur Pathologie,597102,1977

"Hand flexor tenosynovitis in rheumatoid arthritis. Prevalence, distribution, and associated rheumatic features.","Tenosynovitis of one or more flexor tendons of the hand (mean 3.1 tendons per patient) was noted in 55% of 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) examined periodically during a mean period of 5 years. The third flexor tendon was involved most frequently (71% of patients), followed by the second (62%), fourth (53%), fifth (27%), and first (13%). Patients with flexor tendonitis (FT) had a significantly higher prevalence of rheumatoid nodules (56% vs 33%), carpal tunnel syndrome (47% vs 13%), wrist extensor tenosynovitis (47% vs 9%), and elbow epicondylitis (22% vs 7%) than patients without FT. Dupuytren's contracture, DeQuervain's tenovaginitis, flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris tendonitis, and Achilles tendonitis were found exclusively in patients with FT.

Hand images: normal and abnormal.,"Supplemental hand scintigrams with abnormal features were obtained from 29% of patients (134 of 463) who were referred for routine minified bone imaging with 99mTc-Sn-polyphosphate. A wide spectrum of normal activity distribution ranging from well-defined to &quot;wash-out&quot; images is described in 329 cases (71%). In the abnormal images of the joints and individual bones, the changes--although not always characteristic of some particular disease--may often suggest a diagnosis and/or its pathophysiologic status. The joints with heavy uptake correlate well with the presence of active clinical findings, e.g., in the arthritides. The bone feature associated with metabolic disease, especially when full-blown, may be fairly characteristic. A potential application is in the assessment of digital circulation, particularly in obliterative vascular diseases such as scleroderma, Buerger's disease, chronic neuropathies, and possibly other collagen or vascular diseases that involve the hands. Interesting images, probably of somewhat limited usefulness, are observed in some congenital anomalies, fractures, camptodactyly, contracture deformities, unilateral lymphedema after mastectomy, etc.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",870633,1977

"Dupuytren's disease--initial symptoms, age of onset and spontaneous course.","647 men and 254 women with Dupuytren's disease of the hands were questioned about how, where and when the disease had started. Usually the disease started in the right hand, and nodules in the ulnar part of the palm were the first symptom in 90%. In 10% of the cases with bilateral disease, it started simultaneously in both hands. One woman and two men noticed the first symptom before 10 years of age. In about 50% of the men, the disease started between 40-59 years of age (women 40-69 years). In men the contracture increased rather constantly during the first twenty years, followed by a stationary phase from about 20 to thirty-five years of duration, whereafter it definitely decreased. In women the disease increased gradually with the duration of the disease.",The Hand,892619,1977

The experience of the author with a case of bilateral recurrent Dupuytren's contracture with severe shrinkage of the skin and an almost total lack of cooperation on the patient's side is added. It is felt that in spite of a crust formation, which seemed at first to interfere with as excellent a result as reported by Borden, the open skin technique encourages further trials, especially in cases with severe shrinkage of the skin combined with psychic disorders, making the cooperation of the patient poor or impossible.",Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete,842084,1977

In this method the palmar fascia is excised through a transverse incision in the distal plamer crease. The wound is left open. The advantages of this method are: no necrosis of the skin, absence of haematomas, closure of other incisions without tension, early motion with little postoperative discomfort.

[Enzyme patterns in connective tissue proliferations (author's transl)].,"In a series of benign or semimalignant connective tissue proliferations (4 desmoids, 1 recurrence of a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 4 fibromas, 1 neurofibroma, 3 keloids, 3 Dupuytren's contractures) and a normal fascia for comparison the pattern of 18 enzymes from different metabolic pathways was investigated. It should be clarified whether alterations of the enzyme pattern wouldoccur, asthey are found in malignant tumours. The activity of most of the enzymes investigated increased about twofold in the latter of two extirpations (16 months interval) of a recurring desmoid. In the recurrence of a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and in a recurrance of a fibroma a remarkably high activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase was found. High activities of these enzymes are known to be characteristic of experimental tumours of animals and human malignant neoplasms. Therefore it is assumed that these differences from the normal patternof enzyme activity are related to recidivity and may be regarded as first signs of a deviation from benignity. Based on these results further studies haveto be done with the aim to find a biochemical tool for, evaluation and prognosis of the course of these diseases.",Zentralblatt fur allgemeine Pathologie u. pathologische Anatomie,848169,1977

Enzymes of glucose metabolism in palmar fascia and Dupuytren's contracture.,"Several enzymes participating in glucose metabolism and some of the acid hydrolases were assayed in palmar fascia and Dupuytren's contracture with fluorometric microanalytical methods. The enzyme activities of glucose metabolism were lower in normal palmar fascia than in dermis. The fascia of Dupuytren's contracture exhibited a general increase in the enzyme activities of glucose catabolism. Little alteration was found in alanine aminotransferase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity in the lesion. Lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme activities were increased five to ten times in Dupuytren's tissue. The dermis overlying Dupuytren's contracture exhibited an increase in the enzyme activities of glucose catabolism, but to a lesser degree than did the fascia of the lesion. The epidermis of involved palmar skin displayed normal enzyme activities.",The Journal of hand surgery,190288,1977
[Aetiology of dupuytren's contracture (author's transl)].,"Regarding experimental data on the multi-factorial reduction of the thermostability of collagen, the following sequence of the mechanism of Dupuytren's contracture is discussed: 1. Hereditary or acquired weakness of fibres of the palmar fascia 2. Further disturbance of the physical property of collagen by the cumulative effects of mechanical, i.e. traumatic, influence. 3. By this means an induced stepwise shrinkage of released fascial fibres in body temperature. 4. Stabilisation of the shortening (contracture) by development of collagen. This hypothesis is supported by histological, polarizing-microscopic, electron-microscopic and chemical results.","Virchows Archiv. A, Pathological anatomy and histology",827084,1976

Dupuytren's disease--a study of the pattern of distribution and stage of contracture in the hand.,"The distribution and stages of contracture in the digits are examined in 901 persons with Dupuytren's disease and collected into an epidemiological study of 15,950 persons in a small Norwegian town. The frequency of contracted digits counted from the total number of affected hands, are for men (women in parentheses): Thumb 3.0% (0.6), Index finger 1.2% (1.7), Middle finger 28.3% (27.9), Ring finger 85.1% (92.3) and Little finger 45.4% (39.5). The most common combination of affected fingers are ring and little fingers. At corresponding ages, the contracture is more severe in men than in women, and more severe in the right than in the left hand. With the exception of the index finger, the degree of contracture increases from the thumb to the little finger, 29% of the men and 12% of the women examined had contracture of such an extent that surgical treatment was advisable. Only 5.7% of the men and 3.1% of the women had been operated on because of the disease, which indicates that operation statistics are based upon very selected patients. Many aspects of this disease can only be properly studied in epidemiological material.",The Hand,976827,1976
Oedema of the hand after fasciectomy with or without tourniquet.,"Two groups of patients with Dupuytren's disease were treated by limited fasciectomy. A tourniquet was used for one group, and an elevated hand table without tourniquet for the other. Taking into account other factors controlling oedema it was discovered over a post-operative period of twenty-eight days that &quot;Tourniquet&quot; hands remained significantly increased in volume compared to &quot;Non-Tourniquet&quot; hands. Other facts of clinical interest also emerge from the trial and are discussed. It is concluded that the use of the elevated hand table without tourniquet, not only allows an unlimited and uninterrupted period for hand surgery, but also reduces the subsequent oedema.",The Hand,939445,1976
Dupuytren's disease in epilepsy: result of prolonged administration of anticonvulsants.,In a study of chronic epileptics in a residential centre we recorded a 56% incidence of Dupuytren's disease. The lesions were usually bilateral and symmetrical and frequently associated with knuckle pads and plantar nodules. There was no direct relationship between Dupuytren's disease and frozen shoulder. Dupuytren's disease was seen equally in those with idiopathic or symptomatic epilepsy. The incidence increased with the duration of epilepsy and is probably a sequel to long-term administration of phenobarbitone. Reasons are given for presuming that the association between Dupuytren's disease and antiepileptic therapy is mediated through the peripheral stimulation of tissue growth factors and not through the central release of growth hormone or through alterations in liver metabolism.,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",932769,1976
Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Long-term results after fasciotomy and fascial excision.,"Of 359 hands treated surgically for Dupuytren's contracture, 135 were available for study after two years or more, often because of recurrence. Of the sixty-five hands treated by excision of the involved fascia (subtotal fasciectomy), 63 per cent had recurrences in the area operated on but only 15 per cent had sufficient deformity to warrant another operation. Of the forty-one hands treated by palmar fasciotomy, 43 per cent had recurrent deformities severe enough to warrant further surgical treatment. After palmar fasciotomy, improvement at the metacarpohalangeal joint persisted; but, as expected, the deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint progressed just as it did in an untreated control group. The average postoperative period of disability was fifty-nine days after fasciectomy and twenty-one days after fasciotomy. Stiffness and hematoma occurred after fasciectomy but were not observed after fasciotomy. A digital nerve was severed during one fasciotomy and one fasciectomy. Excision of the involved fascia, therefore, gave the best long-term results but was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications.",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

In defense of the open wound.,"In a case of bilateral five-finger Dupuytren contracture, one hand was treated by open excision of the contracutred fascia and shortened skin with application of skin graft. The opposite hand was treated by the &quot;open-palm&quot; technique for comparison. There was no observable difference in the ranges of motion at the end of the two months following surgery.

Own experiences in outpatient saphenectomy, excisions of Dupuytren's contracture, haemorrhoidectomy, mastectomy, herniorrhaphy, enucleation of cold nodes in the thyreoid gland (171 operations between 1972 and 1974) encourage further efforts in this direction.",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,983466,1976
[Dupuytren's palmar fibromatosis--a result of vascular hyperproliferation? Ultrastructural studies (author's transl)].,"Dupuytren's contracture is represented by a proliferation of fibroblasts. In the study presented here 5 cases of Dupuytren's contracture were examined with the aim to conclude from cytological details of the cells to the possibilities of morphogenesis. The cytological pictures varied relative to the organelle composition. Three types of fibroblasts could be found constituting the great majority of cells in Dupuytren's disease: 1. classical fibroblasts, 2. fibroblasts with myoide differentiations and 3. fibroblasts with histiocyte-like features. The second principal finding were the capillaries with increased amount of pericytes and pericyte-like cells somewhat distant from the vessels. The latter observation led to the assumption that pericytes in this lesion are able to migrate from the vascular wall into the surrounding tissue.",Zentralblatt fur allgemeine Pathologie u. pathologische Anatomie,941544,1976
Dupuytren's disease: controversial aspects of management.,"Surgical literature is replete with descriptions of Dupuytren's contracture and the various operations which surgeons have utilized to correct contractures of the palmar fascia. All that is worthy of presentation now are the unknown factors or frontiers of our knowledge. Etiology and control of major complications such as pain, joint stiffness, and recurrence are the frontiers which seem most intriguing to the author. The first step in scientific exploration of these areas is to form a hypothesis which takes into account all of the known factors. In this treatise, the author has stated a hypothesis for each of the frontiers. One hypothesis is that genetic predisposition for selective hyperkinetic collagen metabolism in the palm may be a biological counterpart to the condition found in transversalis fascia in patients with direct inguinal hernia. A hypothesis for pain syndromes is based upon general visceral afferent impulses striking a preconditioned central tract or sensitized central receptor. Joint stiffness has been attributed to the protracted release of polypeptides which change the electrical charge on crystalline protein and result in binding of water which then leads to secondary remodeling of joint structures. Recurrence or persistence of Dupuytren's contracture has been considered to be the result of a persistent inductive phenomenon by cells in the deepest layer of the dermis. Brief arguments supporting these hypotheses as being more tenable now than most others have been presented. For the most part such deductions have been based primarily upon the argument that no other hypothesis presently before us takes into account all of the available data or clinical observations, meager as they may be. Prejudice for surgical biology as a means of enlightenment, intuition, and, at times, empirical reasoning has been admitted in an attempt to stimulate imagination. The rest is left to the reader.",Clinics in plastic surgery,765047,1976
[Angiopasm and lesion of the ulnar nerve in Dupuytren's contracture (author's transl)].,"30 patients with Dupuytren's contracture were investigated by venous occlusion plethysmography of the index and ring fingers of both hands. The results are evaluated in respect to the clinical and electroneurophysiological findings. Special attention was given to the blood flow disturbances which have plethysmographically appeared to be a significant feature of Dupuytren's contracture and also to ulnar nerve lesions in individual cases. The finger venous occlusion plethysmography technique of Goetz (1934) has been further developed and a suitable apparatus constructed for the purpose of these investigations. Temporary vasopasm occurs in 77% of the patients suffering from Dupuytren's contracture when the fingers are cooled to 15 degrees C and a significant diminution of blood flow, as in the Raynaud syndrome, is evident. These neurovascular changes always appeared on the fingers of both hands and were similarly found in the region of the median nerve and of the ulnar nerve. They did not depend on the localization or the stage of the disease. 68% of the patients had symptoms suggestive of an ulnar nerve lesion, which corresponds with the findings of Mumenthaler (1961). In a comparison of the patients with normal plethysmographical findings and the patients with vasospasm, there is no correlation with the accompanying ulnar lesion. It is, thus, suggested that temporary vasopasm is not a consequence of the ulnar nerve lesion, but is related to an independent constitutional factor. In view of the high incidence of the ulnar lesion in patients with Dupuytren's contracture, a special neurological investigation is recommended and appropriate therapy, in addition to the fasiectomy, must be undertaken.",Wiener klinische Wochenschrift.

Chromosome abnormalities in Dupuytren's disease.,"Palmar fascia from six men with Dupuytren's contracture has been grown in tissue-culture and examined cytogenetically; and in three of these cases skin was also studied. Four of the six cases showed mosaicism, but only in cultures of the fascia; the mosaicism was therefore unlikely to be an artefact. Since the abnormalities were inconsistent and absent from skin-cultures they are very unlikely to indicate any mechanism of inheritance. Similar chromosome abnormalities have been reported from experimentally induced tumours.","Lancet (London, England)",54801,1975
[Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture (author's transl)].,"Surgical treatment of Dupuytren's contracture improves function but cannot remove the cause of the disease. Strict selection of cases, knowledge of the anatomy, the use of incisions appropriate to the local alterations, an atraumatic operative technique, and careful aftercare are essential for positive results. The literature cites success rates of between 60 and 85 percent. Recurrences cannot always be avoided but the frequency can be reduced by meticulous removal of all diseased and normal connective tissue in this area.",Langenbecks Archiv fur Chirurgie,1107712,1975
"Wound infection by Prototheca wickerhamii, a saprophytic alga pathogenic for man.","Biopsy of a wound infection of the palmar fascia in a young diabetic woman revealed characteristic periodic acid-Schiff-positive Prototheca species cells with a rosette configuration and internal septation. Prototheca wickerhamii was cultured repeatedly from the wound drainage and the biopsy tissue. Several diagnostic features distinguishing Prototheca species, saprophytic algae, from yeasts are: the formation of endospores by mitosis; greater variation in cell size (2 to 15 mum); the presence of cytoplasmic granules, particularly in old cultures; and the absence of budding forms and pseudomycelia. The organism was resistant to 5-fluorocytosine and the minimal inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B was 12.5 mug/ml. With the exception of the tetracycline group, all other 16 antibacterial agents tested appeared completely ineffective in vitro. A synergism between amphotericin B and tetracycline was clearly demonstrated by the use of the checkerboard method. Infection by Prototheca species may be more common than presently realized due to the common expedient of identifying yeast-like isolates as &quot;yeast--not Candida albicans.&quot;",Journal of clinical microbiology,1225929,1975

Pathology of &quot;knuckle pads&quot;. Study of four cases.,"Histological study of four cases of knuckle pads. The main lesion is a fibroblastic proliferation which developes into dense fibrosis. It is analogous to that found in Dupuytren's contracture or Ledderhose's disease, with which knuckle pads are often associated. This histological feature and the clinical characteristics suggest a nosological entity of nodules situated at the back of the fingers, as a distinct form of fibromatoses and help to delineate knuckle pads from an abarticular manifestation of inflammatory or degenerative rheumatism.","Virchows Archiv.

Significance of histopathological findings in Dupuytren's contracture.,"Clinical and histopathological data were compared in a series of 59 patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) from the years 1946-1971 in order to clarify whether histopathological findings were in accordance with the clinical development of the disease. All well known histopathological features were inspected. The most valuable prognostic sign seemed to be the appearance of several active nodules, indicating rather rapid development of DC, with a high frequency of postoperative recurrence in these patients. Lack of active nodules did not exclude this possibility but made it less likely. Other occasional findings typical of DC such as the number of mitoses, microhaemorrhages, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrations and hypertrophied corpuscles of Vater-Paccini seemed to be of minor prognostic value. Mucopolysaccharides from DC tissue showed metachromasia with toluidine blue did not stain with HID-AB (high iron diamine-alcian blue) as HID positive in specimens preserved embedded in paraffin blocks for several years.",Annales chirurgiae et gynaecologiae Fenniae,55091,1975
Dupuytren's contracture: fibroblast contraction? An ultrastructural study.,"In 6 cases of Dupuytren's disease and 1 of Ledderhose's disease, the nodules of the palmar and plantar aponeurosis were examined by light and electron microscopy. The cells composing these nodules, presumably fibroblasts, showed three significant ultrastructural features: (1) a fibrillar system similar to that of smooth muscle cells; (2) nuclear deformations such as are found in contracted cells, the severest being recognizable by light microscopy (cross-banded nuclei); (3) cell-to-cell and cell-to-stroma attachments. Based on these data and on recent information about the biology of the fibroblasts, it is suggested that these cells are fibroblasts that have modulated into contractile cells (myofibroblasts), and that their contraction plays a role in the pathogenesis of the contracture observed clinically.",The American journal of pathology,5009249,1972
Dupuytren's contracture of the fingers: a simplified approach to the surgical treatment.,"Hematoma formation, delay in healing, pain, stiffened finger joints are complications that sometimes follow classical surgical approaches to Dupuytren's contracture. A new surgical approach to the disease that can correct the contractures without the attendant morbidity is urgently needed. By treating Dupuytren's as any other scar contracture (division of the contracting soft tissue at its point of maximal tension and interposing normal free full-thickness skin) postoperative morbidity can be greatly decreased. Full return of function was achieved within 21 days following operation in 85 percent of the cases in which finger contractures were present before operation. Contracture release of 100 joints was done by this means, with loss of only one graft and without recurrence of the disease. This technique offers simple surgical control of progressive and recurrent Dupuytren's contracture of the fingers with minimal postoperative morbidity.",California medicine,5563816,1971
Dupuytren's contracture--etiology and principles of treatment.,"Although Dupuytren's contracture was first described more than 300 years ago, the cause is not yet certainly known. It is only agreed that the disease process affecting the palmar fascia is most commonly found in older-aged males of Caucasian descent. Conservative or non-surgical treatment is usually ineffective. Surgical treatment includes fasciotomy, partial fasciectomy and total fasciectomy. Fasciotomy is indicated for localized disease or for patients with medical conditions which preclude more extensive operation. Subtotal fasciectomy with or without skin graft is the most commonly employed procedure. Total palmar fasciectomy is seldom indicated. Improved function of the hand can be anticipated after adequate surgical intervention.",California medicine,5798498,1969
